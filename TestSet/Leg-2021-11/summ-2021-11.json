                "text": "\n* Simplified Point 1: The definition of \"terrorist material\" is expanded to include documentation or videos that support or glorifies acts of terror without consideration for their intention when creating such contents. This change can lead up to life imprisonment penalties if found guilty under possession or disseminating these types of propaganda online. Additionally, law enforcement agencies (LEAS) have increased powers regarding stop search procedures aimed at individuals associated with potential threats related to terror activities but safeguarded by additional protection measures put into place beforehand. Lastly there will also exist new offences created specifically targetting those responsible for spreading radicalizing messages over various medium including internet based channels like YouTube etcetera where appropriate punishment ranges vary depending severity level determined after investigation findings conclude accordingly."

    "summary": "The new law will increase penalties for those who possess or distribute material that supports or glorifies terrorism, regardless of their intention. This includes videos, documents, or any other type of content that promotes terrorist activities. The law also gives law enforcement agencies (LEAs) more power to stop and search individuals suspected of being involved in terrorist activities. Additionally, the law creates a new crime category for creating or sharing terrorist propaganda online. Finally, the law lengthens prison sentences for those convicted of terrorist offenses, up to life imprisonment, to further protect public safety and prevent future attacks. The law encourages collaboration between LEAs and the public to identify threats early on and take appropriate action quickly."
