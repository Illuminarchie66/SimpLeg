    "summary": "\nThe Ivory Act 2018 gives law enforcement officials the right to look through and confiscate goods associated with elephant tusk trafficking, including products composed entirely of ivory or containing small quantities of ivory. To find out whether a criminal activity has occurred, officials are allowed to go onto and inspect buildings. They might need to break open packages if essential. People on the site must assist the agents by giving them access to managed things or helping with the hunt. Authorities now have the ability to seize and keep anything linked to the sale of ivory thanks to this new law. Also, it forbids people from purposely blocking cops from carrying out their obligations regarding ivory laws."
