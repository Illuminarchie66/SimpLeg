    "general": "This law makes changes so that people who own houses or flats on long-term rental agreements called \"leaseholds\" do not have to pay as much ground rent each year. It also helps those who want to buy their homes but are having trouble because they can't afford the high fees associated with these types of contracts. Additionally, if you already live somewhere under one of these arrangements\u2014like an apartment building owned by someone else\u2014this new rule might help lower your annual payment too!",
