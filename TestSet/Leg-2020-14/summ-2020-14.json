It further states that these restricted assets should be treated as separate assets from other assets held by the same person.\n* Simplified point 3: The section goes on to state that when a company realizes a fungible asset, the realization should be treated as diminishing a single asset of the company, rather than as multiple realizations of individual assets. This means that the company will only recognize one realization event, rather than multiple events for each individual asset.\n* Simplified point 4: Additionally, the section states that when a company acquires fungible assets, the assets should be treated as part of a single asset, rather than as multiple individual assets.
