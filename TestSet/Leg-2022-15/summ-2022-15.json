    "general": "This law helps figure out how much money will be needed to build new power plants using atomic energy, also called \"nuclear\" energy. It sets up rules so companies can collect fees from customers who use electricity made by these new power plants. The government has decided on a way to run these programs without having too many people involved or spending lots of time talking things over. This makes sure everyone knows exactly where they stand when building something like one of those big machines!",
