    "summary": "The Education and Skills Act of 2008 requires young people aged 16-18 to participate in education or training for at least 20 hours per week, unless they have obtained a level 3 qualification or are employed under a contract of employment. Employers must provide suitable education or training opportunities for their employees, and employees can request time off during regular working hours to participate in such activities. The act sets standards for the quality of education, spiritual and social development, welfare, and leadership in independent educational institutions, and the chief inspector inspects registered independent educational institutions at prescribed intervals to ensure they meet these standards. The act allows the secretary of state to take enforcement action against the proprietor of an independent educational institution if the institution is not meeting certain standards. Additionally, the act defines key terms used in subsequent sections of the Education and Skills Act 2008, and local education authorities are responsible for ensuring that young people receive education or training within their area, regardless of where they reside. Finally, the act requires admission authorities to coordinate admission arrangements for maintained schools in their area, and the adjudicator can refer admission arrangements to an adjudicator if they do not conform with legal requirements."
