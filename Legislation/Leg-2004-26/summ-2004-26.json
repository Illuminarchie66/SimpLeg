    "summary": "The Christmas Day (Trading) Act 2004 says that big stores cannot open on December 25th for regular customers. This means you won't be able to go shopping on Christmas Day at places like department stores or supermarkets. It also limits when trucks and other vehicles can load or unload things at these stores on Christmas Day. This law is enforced by local governments, and special inspectors can check if businesses are following the rules. If they don't follow the rules, they could get fined up to \u00a350,000! This law only applies to England and Wales. So, if you live in Scotland or Northern Ireland, you might still be able to shop on Christmas Day.",
