the forfeiture within the period for objecting, and\n\t\t\t\t\tfailed to make an application within the 30-day period.\n\t\t\t\tOn an application under this section the court must consider whether

measures, if any, that each relevant person is to take inrelation to the aerodrome during the period for which the plan is in force,and\n\t\t\tthe arrangements for monitoring the implementation of those measures(\u201cmonitoring arrangements\u201d).\n\t\tAn aerodrome security plan may specify steps to be taken by a relevantperson for the purposes of the monitoring arrangements (\u201cmonitoring steps\u201d).\n\t\tThe relevant persons are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe manager of the aerodrome,\n\t\t\tthe chief officer of police for the relevant police area,\n\t\t\tany operator of an aircraft that takes

respect of the costsreasonably incurred by B in connection with the security measures, and\n\t\t\tthe amount of those payments or the manner in which their amount is to beassessed.\n\t\tIf the plan specifies security measures to be taken by a person withinsubsection (4)(c) to (h), the plan may also specify that the manager of theaerodrome is to provide accommodation or facilities in connection with thosemeasures.\n\t\tA relevant person must comply with any provision of an aerodrome securityplan which provides that the person is to\u2014\n\t\t\ttake a security measure,\n\t\t\ttake a

to be in force if the aerodrome to whichit relates ceases to be one to which this Part applies.\n\t\tIf there is a dispute about security planning for an aerodrome whichrelates to an aerodrome security plan which is not in force, the Secretary ofState may direct that the plan is to come into force at the beginning of a dayother than that specified in subsection (2)(a) or

fails to inform the othermembers of the group whether the member agrees or disagrees to the inclusionof the provision or (as the case may be) to the variation.\n\t\tIf the Secretary of State at any

step, or\n\t\t\tmake any payments.\n\t\tThis section applies to\u2014\n\t\t\tany relevant person within section 24AE(4)(c) to (e), other than such aperson who is represented on the security executive

30 daysbeginning with the day on which the person was notified of the proposal (\u201cthe30 day period\u201d).\n\t\tThe group must consider an objection made by a person in accordance withthis section.\n\t\tIf the members of the group and the person are unable to reach agreement onwhether or not the proposal should be withdrawn or varied in the light of theobjection, the member of the group who represents the manager of the aerodromemust refer the matter under section 24AN(1) (disputes about security plans).\n\t\tA provision mentioned in subsection (1) may not be included in an
