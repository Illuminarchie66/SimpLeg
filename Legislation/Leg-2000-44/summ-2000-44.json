The law also raises the age limit for consensual heterosexual acts from 16 to 18 years old. Additionally, the legislation creates a defense for individuals under the age of 16 who engage in consensual homosexual acts with someone over the age of 16, as long as their partner is not in a position of trust. The law also prohibits individuals aged 18 or older from engaging in sexual activities with minors in positions of trust. Authorities must approve any orders made under the section through a resolution of each house of parliament. The law applies to both heterosexual and homosexual acts, and covers a range of specific offenses related to sexual activity."
