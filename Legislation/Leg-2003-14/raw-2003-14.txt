### Introduction, 
1This Schedule provides for calculating the tax chargeable—, 
(a)in respect of a chargeable transaction for which the chargeableconsideration consists of or includes rent, or, 
(b)where such a transaction is to be taken into account as a linkedtransaction., 
### Calculation of tax chargeable in respect of rent, 
2(1)Tax is chargeable under this Schedule in respect of so much of thechargeable consideration as consists of rent., 
(2)The tax so chargeable is a percentage of the net present value of the rentpayable over the term of the lease., 
(3)That percentage is determined by reference to whether the relevant land—, 
(a)consists entirely of residential property (in which case Table A belowapplies), or, 
(b)consists of or includes land that is not residential property (in whichcase Table B below applies),, 
and, in either case, by reference to the amount of the relevant rental value., 
#### Table A: Residential, 
Relevant rental value| Percentage  ---|---  Not more than £60,000| 0%  More than £60,000| 1%    #### Table B: Non-residential or mixed, 
Relevant rental value| Percentage  ---|---  Not more than £150,000| 0%  More than £150,000| 1%    (4)For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—, 
(a)the relevant land is the land that is the subject of the lease, and,

(5)If the lease in question is one of a number of linked transactions forwhich the chargeable consideration consists of or includes rent—, 
(a)the relevant land is any land that is the subject of any of those leases,and, 
(b)the relevant rental value is the total of the net present values of therent payable over the terms of those leases., 
### Net present value of rent payable over term of lease, 
3The net present value (v) of the rent payable over the term of a lease iscalculated by applying the formula:, 
[![Formula - v equals the sum from i equals 1 to n of ri divided by \(1 plusT\) to the power ofi](/ukpga/2003/14/images/ukpga_20030014_en_002)](/ukpga/2003/14/images/ukpga_20030014_en_002?view=plain), 
where—, 
  * ri is the rent payable (see paragraphs 4 and 5) in year i, , 
  * i is the first, second, third, etc year of the term, , 
  * n is the term of the lease (see paragraphs 6 and 7), and ,

(3)If the lease provides for a rent review on or before the end of the secondyear of the lease, section 51 (contingent, uncertain or unascertainedconsideration) applies in relation to the possibility that the rent may beadjusted on that review., 
(4)If the lease provides for a rent review after the end of the second year ofthe lease, the annual rent payable after that review—, 
(a)is determined without regard to the possibility of an adjustment on thatreview, and, 
(b)is assumed to be the same as the annual rent payable over the yearpreceding the first rent review or, if the period from the beginning of theterm of the lease to the date of the first rent review is less than a year,over that period.,

(3)For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) the “annual rent” means the averageannual rent over the term of the lease or, if—, 
(a)different amounts of rent are payable for different parts of the term, and,
