paragraph (a), is the treasurer, orperson acting as treasurer, of the company.\n\t\t\tThis subsection does not apply if a liquidator or administrator has beenappointed for the company.\n\t\tIf a liquidator or administrator has been appointed for the company, then,for the purposes of this Part\u2014\n\t\t\tthe liquidator or, as the case may be, the administrator is the properofficer,
