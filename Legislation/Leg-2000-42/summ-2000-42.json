    "summary": "The Disqualifications Act 2000 is a law that keeps politicians from having too much power in the Northern Ireland Assembly. It stops people who hold important positions in the Irish government, like Ministers, from also being members of the Assembly. This helps keep the political system fair and prevents anyone from abusing their power. The law also means that some people can't be appointed to certain roles within the Assembly, like the Commission, to make sure no one person has too much control. Finally, the law changes a previous rule that let Senators (members of the Irish Senate) be part of the Assembly, making it even clearer that there shouldn't be any conflicts of interest.",
    "single": "\n* The Disqualifications Act 2000 removes the disqualification for membership of the House of Commons and the Northern Ireland Assembly for persons who are members of the legislature of Ireland (the Oireachtas).\n* The Act disqualifies for certain offices which may be held by members of the Northern Ireland Assembly persons who are or become Ministers of the Government of Ireland or chairmen or deputy chairmen of committees of the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann or the Seanad \u00c9ireann or of joint committees of the Oireachtas.\n* The Act also disqualifies for certain Assembly offices persons who are holders of disqualifying offices, such as Ministers of the Government of Ireland or chairmen or deputy chairmen of committees of the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann or the Seanad \u00c9ireann.\n* The Act repeals section 36(5) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which allowed a member of Seanad \u00c9ireann to be a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\n* The Act may be cited as the Disqualifications Act 2000."
