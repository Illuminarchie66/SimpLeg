This is intended to protect national security interests and ensure that sensitive information is not misused. The court can review and revoke declarations made under Section 6 of the Act, which allows for the use of closed material procedures in certain cases. The court must consider all material presented during the proceedings when determining whether to revoke the declaration.\nFinally, the Justice and Security Act of 2013 includes provisions related to the handling of sensitive information in national security cases. The government can keep secrets from the public in certain court cases if it's deemed necessary for national security. Rules of court relating to these cases can be created to protect sensitive information, such as allowing hearings to take place without full details of the reasons for decisions being given to parties involved."
