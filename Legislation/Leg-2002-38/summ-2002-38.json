The law requires the court or agency to explore all options before making an adoption order, and allows for contact between the child and their birth family during the adoption process. Additionally, the act sets out the legal requirements for adoption in England and Wales, including the need for parental consent or the dispensation of consent in certain circumstances. It also provides for the disclosure of information regarding adoptions, and establishes regulations to help adults who were adopted before a certain date access information about their adoption and connect with biological family members."
