    "general": "The Deregulation Act 2015 helps reduce unnecessary rules and regulations that are too complicated for businesses, organizations, and individuals. It gets rid of laws that don't work anymore or are not useful. This makes it easier for people to do things without having to follow too many rules. The law also helps ensure that government agencies only use their powers when they need to, so they don't overstep or cause problems. Overall, the goal of the Deregulation Act is to simplify things and make life easier for everyone.",
