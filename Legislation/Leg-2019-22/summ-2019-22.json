    "summary": "The Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019 helps ensure that the government can continue to function properly without an elected executive in Northern Ireland. It does this by extending the deadline for forming an executive until October 21, 2019, and giving the secretary of state the power to further extend the deadline if necessary. Additionally, the act requires the secretary of state to report on progress towards forming an executive and other matters, such as the use of discretionary powers to provide assistance and support, the number of people seeking treatment for problem gambling, and the implementation of the Protect Life 2 - Strategy for Suicide Prevention. Finally, the act requires the UK government to make arrangements for debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords on specific topics related to Northern Ireland."
