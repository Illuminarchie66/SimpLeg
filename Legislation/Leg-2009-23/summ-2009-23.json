    "general": "This law helps protect and manage the ocean, beaches, and coastlines in England and Wales. It makes sure people can safely enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and fishing on these areas, while also keeping them healthy and clean. The law also helps protect certain types of fish that migrate between saltwater and freshwater, like salmon and eel. Additionally, it gives local authorities the power to stop people from doing things that might harm the environment or navigation, like building structures that could block boat traffic. Overall, the goal of this law is to keep our oceans, beaches, and coastlines healthy and accessible for everyone to enjoy.",

    "summary": "The Marine and Coastal Access Act of 2009 regulates human activities in the United Kingdom's marine region to promote sustainable growth while considering scientific data, social and economic variables, and environmental considerations. This includes giving the Marine Management Organization (MMO) the authority to give permits for fishing boats and transhipment licenses for ships, as well as the ability to assign duties to other public organizations and enforce fines for infractions linked to marine and coastal operations. The law also mandates the MMO to preserve a registry of licensing information concerning licensable marine activities and restricts the issuance of fishing licenses to safeguard the marine and aquatic ecosystem and maintain sustainable fisheries. Additionally, the law raises fines for shellfish-related crimes under the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act of 1967 and enables the seizure of vessels suspected of breaking these laws."
