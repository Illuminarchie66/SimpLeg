limits of the territorial seaadjacent to the United Kingdom;\n\t\t\tit is an area of the sea within the limits of the exclusive economic zone;\n\t\t\tit is an area of the sea bed or subsoil within the

Scottish inshore region, or\n\t\t\tthe Northern Ireland inshore region.\n\t\tSection 118 makes further provision as to the areas that may be included inan MCZ.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Chapter the appropriate authority is\u2014\n\t\t\tin relation to an area in Wales, the Welsh Ministers;\n\t\t\tin relation to an area in the Scottish offshore region, the ScottishMinisters;\n\t\t\tin any other case, the Secretary of State.\n\t\tThe Scottish Ministers may not designate any area as an MCZ without theagreement of the Secretary of State.\n\t\tAn MCZ designated by the Scottish Ministers under this section is to beknown as a marine protected area.\n\t\tAny reference in this Act to an MCZ is, in relation to an MCZ designated bythe Scottish Ministers, to be read as a reference to a

subsection (7) to any social consequences of designatingan area as an MCZ includes a reference to any consequences of doing so for anysites in that area (including any sites comprising, or comprising the remainsof, any vessel, aircraft or marine installation) which are of historic orarchaeological interest.\n\tFurther provision as to orders designating MCZs\n\t\tAn order under section 116 must

in area B;\n\t\t\tthat area A is designated for the purpose of conserving marine flora orfauna which are dependent (wholly or in part) on anything which takes placein, or is present in, area B;\n\t\t\tthat, without the inclusion of area B, the identification of the boundaryof the MCZ (either in the order designating the area or on the ground for thepurposes of exercising functions in relation to it) would be impossible orimpracticable.\n\t\tAn order under section 116\u2014\n\t\t\tmust designate an area of land (whether or not that land is covered bywater), and\n\t\t\tin the case

lies in the Northern Ireland zone.\n\t\tIf the appropriate authority fails to make the order before the end of theperiod of 12 months beginning with the date on which notice was publishedunder subsection (2), then anything done by the appropriate authority for thepurposes of complying with subsections (2) to (9) of this section is, forthose purposes, to be treated as not having been done.\n\t\tIn a case where the appropriate authority thinks that there is an urgentneed to protect the area proposed to be designated, the authority need notcomply with subsections (2) to (4).\n\t\tIn such a case, the order designating the area as an MCZ remains in forcefor a period not exceeding two years, unless the appropriate authority makes afurther order before the end of that period confirming the designation.\n\t\tBefore making such an order, the appropriate authority must comply withsubsections (2) to (9) (and subsection (10) applies accordingly).\n\tPublication of orders designating MCZs\n\t\tThis section applies where an order has been made under section 116.\n\t\tThe appropriate authority must publish notice of the making of the order.\n\t\tThe notice under subsection (2) must\u2014\n\t\t\tbe published in such manner as the appropriate authority thinks is mostlikely to bring the order to the attention of any persons who are likely to beaffected by the

make an order under section 116 designating an area as anMCZ.\n\t\tThe authority may, before making that decision, give to any person theopportunity of\u2014\n\t\t\tappearing before and being heard by a person appointed for that purpose;\n\t\t\tproviding written representations to such a person.\n\t\tThe authority may make regulations providing for the procedure to befollowed (including decisions as to costs) at hearings held under subsection(2).\n\t\tA person appointed under subsection (2) must make a report to the authorityof any oral or written representations made under that subsection.\n\tAmendment, revocation and review of orders designating MCZs\n\t\tAn order under section 116 may be amended or revoked by a further order.\n\t\tThe appropriate authority for an area must

event or the likelihood of the event could not reasonably have beenforeseen.\n\t\t\tSchedule 26 to this Act (procedure relating to byelaws made by the Agency)does not apply in relation to an emergency

revocation\n\t\t\tIf at any time the appropriate national authority is satisfied that anemergency fisheries byelaw would better serve to prevent or limit the harmreferred to in paragraph 1(2)(a) above if it were amended, the authority mustamend it accordingly.\n\t\t\tIf at any time the appropriate national authority is satisfied that anemergency fisheries byelaw is no longer needed in order to

access scheme\n\t\tNatural England must\u2014\n\t\t\tprepare a scheme setting out the approach it will take when discharging thecoastal access duty, and\n\t\t\tsubmit the scheme to the Secretary of State.\n\t\tThe Secretary of State may\u2014\n\t\t\tapprove the scheme, with or without modifications, or\n\t\t\treject the scheme and give Natural England a notice requiring it to prepareand submit a new scheme under subsection (1).\n\t\tThe scheme must be submitted to the Secretary of State within the period of12 months beginning with the day on which this section comes into force or, ina case within subsection (2)(b), within the period specified in the notice.\n\t\tNatural England may, with the approval of the Secretary of State, revise ascheme approved under this section.\n\t\tA scheme approved under this section (and any revised scheme) must set outthe approach Natural England will take when deciding, for the purposes ofsection 55A(4) of the 1949 Act, whether it would be appropriate for an accessauthority to carry out any preliminary activity (within the meaning of section55A(3) of that Act).\n\t\tThe Secretary of State must lay before Parliament a copy of the schemeapproved under this section and, where that scheme is revised, a copy of therevised scheme.\n\t\tBefore preparing or revising a scheme under this section, Natural Englandmust consult such persons as it considers appropriate.\n\t\tNatural England must, as soon as reasonably practicable, publish in suchmanner as it considers appropriate\u2014\n\t\t\tthe scheme approved by the Secretary of State, and\n\t\t\twhere that scheme is revised, the revised scheme.\n\t\tIn discharging the coastal access duty, Natural England must act inaccordance with the scheme approved under this section (or, where that schemehas been revised, the revised scheme).\n\t\tUntil such time as there is an approved scheme under this section, NaturalEngland may not prepare or submit a report under section 51 or 55 of the 1949Act (report containing proposals for long-distance routes) pursuant to thecoastal access duty.\n\t\tNothing in subsection (10) prevents Natural England from surveying anyland in connection with the preparation of such a report.\n\tReview of the coastal access scheme\n\t\tWhere a scheme has been approved under section 298, Natural England may,from time to time, review the scheme (as revised from time to time under thatsection).\n\t\tAt least one review must be completed within the period of 3 yearsbeginning with the day on which a scheme is first approved under section298(2).\n\t\tNatural England must publish a report of each review under this section assoon as reasonably practicable after the review is completed.\n\tThe English coast\n\t\tIn this Part \u201cthe English coast\u201d means the coast of England adjacent to thesea, including the coast of any island (in the sea) comprised in England(other than an excluded island).\n\t\tAn island is \u201cexcluded\u201d if it is neither\u2014\n\t\t\tan accessible island, nor\n\t\t\tan island specified by the Secretary of State by order for the purposes ofthis paragraph.\n\t\tAn island is \u201caccessible\u201d if it is possible to walk to the island from themainland of England, or from another island within subsection (2)(a) or (b),across the foreshore or by means of a bridge, tunnel or causeway.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (3), it is possible to walk to an islandeven if it is possible to do so at certain times, or during certain periods,only.\n\t\tAn island may be specified by an order under subsection (2)(b) only if theSecretary of State is satisfied that the coast of the island is of sufficientlength to enable the establishment of one or more long-distance routes alongits length capable of affording the public an extensive journey on foot.\n\t\tFor the purposes of the objective in section 296(2) (the English coastalroute), the means of access to an accessible island is (to the extent that itwould not otherwise be the case) to be regarded as part of the English coast.\n\t\tThis section is subject to section 307 (Isles of Scilly).\n\tRiver estuaries\n\t\tThis section applies in a case where the continuity of any part of theEnglish coast is interrupted by a river.\n\t\tNatural England may exercise its functions as if the references in thecoastal access provisions to the sea included the relevant upstream waters ofthe river.\n\t\tFor this purpose \u201cthe relevant upstream waters\u201d, in relation to a river,means\u2014\n\t\t\tthe waters from the seaward limit of the estuarial waters of the riverupstream to the first public foot crossing, or\n\t\t\tif Natural England so decides, the waters from the seaward limit of theestuarial waters of the river upstream to such limit, downstream of the firstpublic foot crossing, as may be specified by it.\n\t\tWhen exercising any power conferred by subsection (2) or (3), NaturalEngland must have regard to the following matters (in addition to the mattersmentioned in section 297(2))\u2014\n\t\t\tthe nature of the land which would, for the purposes of this Part, becomepart of the coast of England if Natural England exercised the power insubsection (2) in respect of the relevant upstream waters for the limit underconsideration;\n\t\t\tthe topography of the shoreline adjacent to those waters;\n\t\t\tthe width of the river upstream to that limit;\n\t\t\tthe recreational benefit to the public of the coastal access duty beingextended to apply in relation to the coast adjacent to those waters;\n\t\t\tthe extent to which the land bordering those waters would, if it werecoastal margin, be excepted land;\n\t\t\twhether it is desirable to continue the English coastal route to aparticular physical feature (whether of the landscape or otherwise) orviewpoint;\n\t\t\tthe existence of a ferry by which the public may cross the river.\n\t\tAnything done pursuant to subsection (2) (including any decision undersubsection (3)(b)) is to be regarded as done pursuant to, and for the purposeof discharging, the coastal access duty.\n\t\tSubsections (1) to (5) apply in relation to the Secretary of State as theyapply in relation to Natural England.\n\t\tA decision by Natural England to exercise a power conferred by subsection(2) or (3) in relation to a river\u2014\n\t\t\tis without prejudice to any decision by the Secretary of State (by virtueof subsection (6)) as to whether or not to exercise such a power in relationto the river, and\n\t\t\tdoes not affect the requirements of subsection (4) (as they apply by virtueof subsection (6)) or of section 297(2) and (3), in relation to such adecision by the Secretary of State.\n\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201ccoastal
