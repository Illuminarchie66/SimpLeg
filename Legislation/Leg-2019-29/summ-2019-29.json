    "summary": "The Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 says that there will be a big vote to choose who will run the country (called a general election) on December 12th, 2019. This is happening because of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which says when elections should happen. Even though it's a special day (a non-bank holiday), you have until a certain amount of time to tell the authorities if you want to register to vote. Once this law is passed, it becomes official and starts working right away! So get ready to cast your vote and decide who will lead the country!",
