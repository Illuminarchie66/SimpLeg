    "summary": "The National Insurance Contributions Act 2015 simplifies and modernizes the way National Insurance contributions are handled in the UK. Specifically, it provides relief for young apprentices by exempting them from paying National Insurance contributions until they turn 25 years old. Additionally, the law gives the government more flexibility to change National Insurance rates and thresholds over time. Finally, the law includes measures to prevent abuse of the system by those who try to manipulate their employment status to avoid paying National Insurance contributions."
