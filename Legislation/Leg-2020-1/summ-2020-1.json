    "summary": "The European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 is a law passed by the UK parliament to ensure that the rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies, and procedures established by the withdrawal agreement are given legal effect and enforced in domestic law. The act applies to all aspects of the withdrawal agreement, including the EEA EFTA separation agreement and the Swiss citizens\u2019 rights agreement, and ensures that these agreements are recognized and available in domestic law. The UK government has the power to make regulations related to the implementation period of the withdrawal agreement, which includes provisions for modifying existing laws and making new provisions as needed. The regulations can include provisions for other modifications, exceptions, and exemptions related to the implementation period, and can be made up to two years after the IP completion day. Additionally, the UK government can make regulations to specify deadlines for EU citizens to apply for residence in the UK after Brexit, provide temporary protection for EU citizens who have not yet applied for residence, and implement the rights of frontier workers under the Withdrawal Agreement, the EEA EFTA separation agreement, and the Swiss citizens' rights agreement. Finally, the UK government can pay money to the EU or EU entities to meet any obligations it has under the withdrawal agreement, and must review EU legislation during the implementation period and report back to Parliament on any matters of vital national interest."
