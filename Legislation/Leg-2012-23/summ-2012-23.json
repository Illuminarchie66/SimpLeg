    "summary": "\nThe Small Charitable Donations Act of 2012 helps boost charity funds with top-up payments! \ud83d\udcb0\nEligible charities can get extra money based on small donations made to them. To qualify, charities must have successfully claimed gift aid exemptions in past years and meet certain conditions about the size of the donations and their status. \ud83d\udcdd\nTop-ups are capped at \u00a35,000 or ten times the amount of gift aid donations, whichever is less. And, if a charity misbehaves or makes false claims, they might not be eligible for top-ups. \ud83d\udeab\nSmall donations include gifts from individuals, but exclude membership fees. If a small donation is used for non-charitable purposes, it might not count towards top-ups. \ud83e\udd14\nMultiple charities can combine their small donations to receive additional relief. Connected charities, like those with shared trustees, can also receive top-ups. Community buildings, like churches or village halls, can host charitable activities and receive top-ups too! \ud83c\udfe2\nHMRC manages the top-up payments and can create regulations to ensure fairness and accuracy. Overpayments must be repaid, and there are rules for appeals and penalties. \ud83d\udcc8\nSo, if you're a charity looking to boost your funds, keep track of your small donations and make sure you meet the requirements for top-up payments under the Small Charitable Donations Act of 2012! \ud83d\udcaa"
