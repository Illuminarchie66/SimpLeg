finding or cautionwhich occurred on or after 1 September 1997,\n\t\t\tthe first condition is met because of a conviction or finding whichoccurred before that date, but P was dealt with in respect of the offence orfinding on or after that date, or has yet to be dealt with in respect of it,or\n\t\t\tthe first condition is met because of a conviction or finding whichoccurred before that date, but on that date P was, in respect of the offenceor finding, subject under the law in force in the country concerned todetention, supervision or any other disposal equivalent to any of thosementioned in section 81(3) (read with sections 81(6) and 131).\n\t\tThe third condition is that the period set out in section 82 (as it wouldhave effect as modified by section 96ZC(2) and (3) if this section applied toP) in respect of the relevant offence has not expired.\n\t\tIn this section and section 96ZC \u201crelevant offence\u201d means an act which\u2014\n\t\t\tconstituted an offence under the law in force in the country concerned, and\n\t\t\twould have constituted an offence listed in Schedule 3 (other than atparagraph 60) if it had been done in any part of the United Kingdom.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (9)(a), an act punishable under the law inforce in a country outside the United Kingdom constitutes an offence underthat law however it is described in that law.\n\tZBYoung offenders: parental notices\n\t\tWhere the person (\u201cP\u201d) given a notice under section 96ZA is under 18 aconstable may also give a notice (a \u201cparental notice\u201d) to a person (\u201ctheparent\u201d) with parental responsibility for P.\n\t\tSubsections (3)(b) to (5) of section 96ZA apply to the giving of a parentalnotice as if references to P were references to the

byvirtue of section 96ZA on P are to be treated instead as obligations on theparent, and\n\t\t\tthe parent must ensure that P attends with them at the police station whena notification under this Part is being given.\n\t\tThe parental notice ceases to have effect when P reaches the age of 18.\n\t\tIf a parental notice is to be given, section 96ZA(4)(a) has effect inrelation to the notice given to P as if the reference to the notificationsthat P is required to give under this Part were a reference to\u2014\n\t\t\tthe notifications that the parent is required to give under this Part, and\n\t\t\tthe notifications (if any) that P is required to give under this Part oncethe parental notice ceases to have effect.\n\tZCModifications of notification requirements\n\t\tThe application of this Part to a person (\u201cP\u201d) to whom section 96ZA appliesin respect of a conviction, finding or caution is subject to the modificationsset out in this section.\n\t\tReferences to the \u201crelevant date\u201d\u2014\n\t\t\tin a case where P is within section 96ZA(6)(a), are to the date of theconviction,\n\t\t\tin a case where P is within section 96ZA(6)(b) or (c), are to the date ofthe finding, and\n\t\t\tin a case where P is within section 96ZA(6)(d), are to the date of thecaution.\n\t\tIn section 82\u2014\n\t\t\treferences, except in the Table, to a person (or relevant offender) withinany provision of section 80 are to be read as references to P;\n\t\t\tthe reference in the Table to section 80(1)(d) is to be read as a referenceto section 96ZA(6)(d);\n\t\t\treferences to an order of any description are to be read as references toany corresponding disposal made in relation to P in respect of an offence orfinding by reference to which a notice has been given to P under section 96ZA;\n\t\t\tthe reference to offences listed in Schedule 3 is to be read as a referenceto relevant offences (see section 96ZA(9)).\n\t\tSection 83 has effect as if after subsection (1) there were inserted\u2014\n\t\t\t\u201c(1A)In the case of a relevant offender who is subject to the notificationrequirements of this Part by virtue of a notice being given to the relevantoffender under section 96ZA, the reference in subsection (1) to the period of3 days beginning with the relevant date (or if later the commencement of thisPart) is to be read as a reference to the period of 3 days beginning with theday on which the notice was given to the relevant offender.\u201d\n\t\tSection 83(4) has effect as if\u2014\n\t\t\tfor the words \u201cWhere a notification order is made\u201d there were substituted\u201cWhere a relevant offender is subject to the notification requirements of thisPart by virtue of a notice given under section 96ZA\u201d, and\n\t\t\tin paragraph (a) for the words \u201cthe order was made\u201d there were substituted\u201cthe notice was given to the relevant offender\u201d.\n\tZDAppeal against the issue of a notice under section 96ZA or 96ZB\n\t\tA person (\u201cP\u201d) may appeal to a magistrates\u2019 court against the decision togive them a notice under section 96ZA.\n\t\tThe grounds for bringing an appeal under subsection (1) include\u2014\n\t\t\tthat one or more of the conditions for the giving of the notice were notmet in respect of P at the time the notice was given;\n\t\t\tthat the conviction, finding or caution by reason of which P was given thenotice falls within subsection (3).\n\t\tA conviction, finding or caution falls within this subsection if\u2014\n\t\t\tany investigations or proceedings leading to it were conducted in a waywhich contravened any of the Convention rights (within the meaning of section1 of the Human Rights Act 1998) which P would have had if those investigationsor proceedings had taken place in the United Kingdom, and\n\t\t\tthat contravention was such that the conviction, finding or caution cannotbe safely relied on for the purposes of meeting the condition in section96ZA(6).\n\t\tA person (\u201cthe parent\u201d) may appeal to a magistrates\u2019 court against thedecision to give them a parental notice under section 96ZB.\n\t\tThe grounds for bringing an appeal under subsection (4) include\u2014\n\t\t\tthat one or more of the conditions for the giving of a notice under section96ZA to the person (\u201cP\u201d) for whom the parent has parental responsibility werenot met in respect of P at the time the notice under section 96ZA was given;\n\t\t\tthat the conviction, finding or caution by reason of which P was given anotice under
