34.\n\t\tThe court must have regard to the principle that exemplary damages must notusually be awarded if, at any time before the decision comes to be made, thedefendant has been convicted of an offence involving the conduct complainedof.\n\t\tThe court must take account of the following\u2014\n\t\t\twhether membership of an approved regulator was available to the defendantat the material

of punishment.\n\t\tThis section is not to be read as limiting the power of the court to takeaccount of any other matters it considers relevant to its decision.\n\tAmount of exemplary damages\n\t\tThis section applies where the court decides to award exemplary damagesunder section 34.\n\t\tThe court must have regard to these principles in determining the amount ofexemplary damages\u2014\n\t\t\tthe amount must not be more than the minimum needed to punish the defendantfor the conduct complained of;\n\t\t\tthe amount must be proportionate to the seriousness of the

(\u201cthepersons affected\u201d).\n\t\tIn deciding whether to award exemplary damages under section 34 or theamount of such damages to award (whether to one or more of the personsaffected), the court

is nevertheless to be regarded as such ifthe person was a member of an approved regulator at the material time.\n\tOther interpretative provisions\n\t\tThis section applies for the purposes of
