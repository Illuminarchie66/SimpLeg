    "general": "This law is about helping people who have been hurt by someone they know, like a partner or family member. It creates a new commissioner to help these people and makes some changes to the way courts handle cases of domestic abuse. It also makes some new crimes illegal, like threatening to share intimate photos without permission and choking or suffocating someone. The goal of the law is to protect people from being hurt again and to punish those who do these bad things.",

    "summary": "The Domestic Abuse Act 2021 is a new law that helps protect people who are experiencing domestic abuse. It defines \"domestic abuse\" as any behavior that is hurtful or threatening, and it applies to anyone who is personally connected to the person being abused, like a spouse, partner, or relative. The law also covers economic abuse, which means when someone uses money or resources to control or manipulate their partner. Children can also be considered victims of domestic abuse if they witness or experience the effects of the abuse.\n\nThe law creates a new position called the Domestic Abuse Commissioner, who will work to help victims of domestic abuse and monitor how well the government and other organizations are addressing the issue. The Commissioner will not have any special legal powers or immunities, but they will be able to advise the government and others on how to improve their response to domestic abuse.\n\nIf someone is being abused, they can ask the court for a \"domestic abuse protection order,\" which can limit the abuser's contact with them or force them to stay away from certain places. The court will consider many factors when deciding whether to grant the order, including the risk of harm to the person being protected and whether the abuser is likely to comply with the order.\n\nThe law also updates existing penalties for domestic violence offenses, including adding new offenses for threatening to reveal private sexual photos or videos and for strangulation or suffocation. These changes aim to better protect victims of domestic abuse and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions."
