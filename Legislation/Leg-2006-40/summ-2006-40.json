    "general": "The Education and Inspections Act of 2006 is a law that deals with primary, secondary, and further education in England and Wales. It also covers training programs for teachers and other educators. The law creates an office called the Office for Standards in Education, which oversees the quality of education and makes sure that schools are meeting certain standards. This office appoints a chief inspector who checks on how well schools are doing and reports back to the government. The law also changes some words and phrases used in previous laws so that they apply better to modern education systems. Finally, the law makes small changes to a different law from 1967 that affects universities.",
