this Step,, 
is nil, or less than nil, the profits of the tax year 2023-24 for the purposesof Chapter 2 of Part 2 of ITTOIA 2005 is the amount given by this Step (andsee paragraph 71 for the treatment of a loss, or an increased loss, for thetax year 2023-24 arising from this Step).,

73(1)If the trader is liable to a charge to income tax for a tax year on anamount of the transition profits for the tax year 2023-24 (see Step 5 of thecalculation in paragraph 70(2) and paragraph 72), the trader may elect for anadditional amount of those profits to be treated as arising in the tax year., 
(2)The election must be made on or before the first anniversary of the normalself-assessment filing date for the tax year to which it relates., 
(3)The election must specify the amount of the transition profits to betreated as arising in the tax year (which may be any amount of those profitsnot previously charged to tax).,

(2)To find the trader’s liability to income tax for the tax year, section 23of ITA 2007 applies as if—, 
(a)the amount of the transition profits chargeable to income tax were aseparate component of total income (“the transition component”),, 
(b)the transition component were relieved in accordance with Step 2,, 
(c)the amount of the transition component left after Step 2 were left out ofthe calculation of net income (and subsequent Steps), and, 
(d)for the purposes of Steps 5 to 7, the amount (if any) given by sub-paragraph (3) were treated as an amount of tax calculated at Step 4., 
(3)The amount given by this sub-paragraph is the difference between—, 
(a)the total amount of tax that would be calculated at Step 5 if Steps 1 to 4were applied in accordance with sub-paragraph (2)(a) to (c) (ignoring sub-paragraph (2)(d)), and, 
(b)the total amount of tax that would be calculated at Step 5 if Steps 1 to 4were applied in accordance with sub-paragraph (2)(a) and (b) (ignoring sub-paragraph (2)(c) and (d)).,

unless the partnership or trust constitutes a transparent qualifying fund., 
(5)Where—, 
(a)such a partner or a trustee of such a trust has a priority entitlement,over other partners or trustees, to profits or gains arising from thepartnership or trust, and, 
(b)that priority entitlement arises as a result of contractual arrangementsrelating to the management of the investments of the partnership or trust,, 
those profits or gains are to be ignored in making any determination of anyperson’s relevant interest in a company or in an enhanced class of a companyto the extent the entitlement is related to those arrangements., 
(6)Where securities of a company held through such a partnership or trustconfer voting power in that company, that power is to be treated as the powerof the partners, or (as the case may be) the beneficiaries, divided betweenthem in the same proportions as they would be entitled to profits arising fromthose securities., 
(7)In this paragraph—, 
  * “securities” has the same meaning it has in paragraph 3; , 
  * an entity (“E”) is “transparent” if investments of E would be regarded, for the purposes of corporation tax on chargeable gains, as the investments of another entity (such as a member or partner of E or the beneficiary of a trust). ,
