    "summary": "The Taxis and Private Hire Vehicles (Safeguarding and Road Safety) Act 2022 is a law that aims to protect passengers and ensure road safety by making it easier to check if taxi and private hire vehicle drivers have a history of sexual offenses or other forms of misconduct. The law creates a new database to store information about licensing decisions for these drivers, and allows licensing authorities to share information about drivers who have been reported for misconduct. Additionally, the law requires drivers to provide information about their criminal records before being licensed, and gives the government the power to make regulations and issue guidance to help implement the law."
