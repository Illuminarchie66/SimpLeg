    "summary": "The Driving Instructors (Registration) Act 2016 helps keep driving instructors up to date with the latest knowledge and skills so they can teach safe driving practices to learners. This law requires driving instructors to pass tests to show they still know how to drive safely and teach well. If an instructor's registration expires, they might need to take another test to get back on the list of approved instructors. Some instructors might choose to stop teaching driving altogether, but if they made a mistake or someone did something bad to get them taken off the list, they can ask to go back on. Overall, this law aims to make sure only good drivers are teaching others how to drive.",
