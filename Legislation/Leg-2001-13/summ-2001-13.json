    "general": "This law allows members of the clergy to run for seats in the House of Commons, which they were previously not allowed to do due to their religious affiliations. It also keeps the current ban on Lords Spiritual (members of the Church of England who sit in the House of Lords) running for seats in the House of Commons. Essentially, this law opens up the opportunity for more people to participate in the political process by removing barriers based on religion.",

    "summary": "The House of Commons (Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Act 2001 allows religious leaders, known as clergy, to become members of the House of Commons without facing discrimination because of their faith. This means they can now run for political office without worrying about being disqualified based on their religious beliefs. However, the law still prevents Lords Spiritual, who represent the Church of England in the upper house, from becoming members of the House of Commons. This act repeals old laws that unfairly targeted clergy and updates the legislation to make it more relevant today. In short, this law helps ensure fairness and equality for all religions in British politics.",
