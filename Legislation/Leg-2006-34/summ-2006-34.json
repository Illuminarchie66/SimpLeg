    "general": "The Civil Aviation Act 2006 is a law that helps regulate air travel in the United Kingdom. It makes sure that airlines are honest with their customers and provide good service. The law also sets up a special fund called the Air Travel Trust, which protects passengers' money if an airline goes bankrupt. This way, people can still get refunds or compensation if something goes wrong with their flight.",

    "summary": "The Civil Aviation Act 2006 sets the legal framework for regulating aircraft noise and emissions in the UK. It empowers aerodrome authorities to set charges based on noise and emissions, establishes noise control schemes, and mandates the Secretary of State to consider the interests of people living near airports. The law also provides for penalty schemes to address non-compliance with noise requirements and allows for modifications or repeals of these schemes. Additionally, the government has the scope to specify additional activities for public airport companies beyond their core business, and there are new safety measures to protect passenger health on flights. Finally, the documentation standards have been revised to allow for more flexibility in using documents as evidence in aviation-related matters."
