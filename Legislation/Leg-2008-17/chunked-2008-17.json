provision about the periods during which and in respect of whichannual fees are payable.\n\t\t\tThe regulator may set different fees, and make different provision, fordifferent cases or circumstances.\n\t\t\tFees must be set in accordance with principles which the regulator preparesand publishes and which are designed to ensure that so far as is reasonablypracticable\u2014\n\t\t\t\tfee income matches expenditure on the performance of functions,\n\t\t\t\teach fee is reasonable and proportionate to the costs to which it relates,and\n\t\t\t\tactual or potential registered providers can see the relationship betweenthe amount of a fee and the costs to which it relates.\n\t\t\tThe principles\u2014\n\t\t\t\tshall provide for section 95(3) to be disregarded for the purpose ofsubsection (5)(a), and\n\t\t\t\tmay provide for specified expenditure or potential expenditure undersection 95 or otherwise to be disregarded for

appearing to the regulator to represent the interests of fee-payers.\n\t\t\tThe regulator\u2019s accounts shall show\u2014\n\t\t\t\tfees received, and\n\t\t\t\tfees outstanding.\n\t\tDe-registration:

or\n\t\t\t\thas ceased to exist.\n\t\t\tBefore removing a body under subsection (1)(a) or (b) the regulator must\u2014\n\t\t\t\ttake all reasonable steps to give the body at least 14 days' notice, and\n\t\t\t\tconsider any representations it makes in that period.\n\t\t\tAfter removing a body under subsection (1)(a) or (b) the regulator musttake all reasonable steps to notify the body.\n\t\tDe-registration: voluntary\n\t\t\tA registered provider may ask the regulator to remove it from the register.\n\t\t\tThe regulator may comply with a request\u2014\n\t\t\t\ton the grounds that the registered provider no longer is or intends to be aprovider of social housing in England,\n\t\t\t\ton the grounds that the registered provider is subject to regulation byanother authority whose control is likely to be sufficient, or\n\t\t\t\ton the grounds that the registered provider meets any relevant criteria forde-registration set by the regulator.\n\t\t\tBefore deciding whether or not to comply, the regulator must consult suchlocal authorities in whose area the registered provider acts as it thinksappropriate.\n\t\t\tThe regulator shall not comply with a request by a non-profit registeredprovider if it thinks that removal is sought with a view to enabling theregistered provider to distribute assets to members.\n\t\t\tIn deciding whether or not to comply, the regulator must (in particular)have regard to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tany conditions imposed in connection with disposal consents given to theregistered provider under Chapter 5, and\n\t\t\t\tany conditions imposed in connection with financial assistance given to theregistered provider under any enactment.\n\t\t\tHaving decided whether or not to remove the registered provider theregulator must

reasonably practicable after registering or de-registering abody the regulator shall notify\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a registered charity, the Charity Commission,\n\t\t\t\tin the case of an industrial and provident society, the Financial ServicesAuthority, and\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a registered company (whether or not also a registeredcharity), the registrar of companies for England

shall notify any person notifiedof the registration.\n\t\t\tA person to whom notice is given under this section must keep a record ofit.\n\t\tAppeal \n\t\t\tA body may appeal to the High Court against a decision of the regulator\u2014\n\t\t\t\tto refuse to register it,\n\t\t\t\tto de-register it, or\n\t\t\t\tto refuse to de-register it.\n\t\t\tThe regulator shall not de-register a body while an
