        "text": "\nCHAPTER 1Deferment of sentence\n\tDeferment order\n\t\tIn this Code \u201cdeferment order\u201d means an order deferring passing sentence onan offender in respect of one or more offences until the date specified in theorder, to enable a court, in dealing with the offender, to have regard to\u2014\n\t\t\tthe offender\u2019s conduct after conviction (including, where appropriate, theoffender\u2019s making reparation for the offence), or\n\t\t\tany change in the offender\u2019s circumstances.\n\t\tA deferment order may impose requirements (\u201cdeferment requirements\u201d) as tothe offender\u2019s conduct during the period of deferment.\n\t\tDeferment requirements may include\u2014\n\t\t\trequirements as to the residence of the offender during all or part of theperiod of deferment;\n\t\t\trestorative justice requirements.\n\tAvailability of deferment order\n\t\tA deferment order is available to the Crown Court or a magistrates\u2019 courtin respect of an offence where\u2014\n\t\t\tthe offender is before the court to be dealt with for the offence, and\n\t\t\tno previous deferment order has been made in respect of the offence.\n\t\t\t\tSee also section 11(4) (power of Crown Court to make further deferment orderwhere magistrates\u2019 court commits offender for sentence).\n\t\tBut a deferment order is not available to a magistrates\u2019 court dealing withan offender in respect of an offence for which section 85(1)(a) (compulsoryreferral conditions) requires the court to make a referral order.\n\tMaking a deferment order\n\t\tA court may make a deferment order in respect of an offence only if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe offender consents,\n\t\t\tthe offender undertakes to comply with any deferment requirements the courtproposes to impose,\n\t\t\tif those requirements include a restorative justice requirement, section7(2) (consent of participants in restorative justice activity) is satisfied,and\n\t\t\tthe court is satisfied, having regard to the nature of the offence and thecharacter and circumstances of the offender, that it would be in the interestsof justice to make the order.\n\t\tThe date specified under section 3(1) in the order may not be more than 6months after the date on which the order is made.\n\t\tA court which makes a deferment order must forthwith give a copy of theorder\u2014\n\t\t\tto the offender,\n\t\t\tif it imposes deferment requirements that include a restorative justicerequirement, to every person who would be a participant in the activityconcerned (see section 7(1)),\n\t\t\twhere an officer of a provider of probation services has been appointed toact as a supervisor, to that provider, and\n\t\t\twhere a person has been appointed under section 8(1)(b) to act as asupervisor, to that person.\n\t\tA court which makes a deferment order may not on the same occasion remandthe offender, notwithstanding any enactment.\n\tEffect of deferment order\n\t\tWhere a deferment order has been made in respect of an offence, the courtwhich deals with the offender for the offence may have regard to\u2014\n\t\t\tthe offender\u2019s conduct after conviction, or\n\t\t\tany change in the offender\u2019s circumstances.\n\t\tThe matters to which the court may have regard in dealing with the offenderinclude, in particular\u2014\n\t\t\twhere appropriate, the making by the offender of reparation for theoffence, and\n\t\t\tthe extent to which the offender has complied with any defermentrequirements.\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies where\u2014\n\t\t\tthe court which made a deferment order proposes to deal with the offenderon the date specified in the order, or\n\t\t\tthe offender does not appear on that date.\n\t\tThe court may\u2014\n\t\t\tissue a summons requiring the offender to appear before the court at thetime and place specified in the summons, or\n\t\t\tissue a warrant for the offender\u2019s arrest which requires the offender to bebrought before the court at the time and place specified in the warrant.\n\t\tSubsection (6) applies where a magistrates\u2019 court makes a deferment order.\n\t\tIn making the order the court is to be regarded as having adjourned thetrial under section 10(1) of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts Act 1980.\n\t\t\tAccordingly, sections 11(1) and 13(1) to (3A) and (5) of that Act (non-appearance of the accused) apply if the offender does not appear on the datespecified in the deferment order (but this is without prejudice to subsection(4)).\n\tRestorative justice requirements\n\t\tAny reference in this Chapter to a restorative justice requirement is to arequirement to participate in an activity\u2014\n\t\t\twhere the participants consist of, or include, the offender and one or moreof the victims,\n\t\t\twhich aims to maximise the offender\u2019s awareness of the impact of theoffending concerned on the victims, and\n\t\t\twhich gives an opportunity to a victim or victims to talk about, or byother means express experience of, the offending and its impact.\n\t\tA restorative justice requirement may not be imposed as a defermentrequirement without the consent of every person who would be a participant inthe activity.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (2), a supervisor and the offender do notcount as proposed participants.\n\t\tA person running an activity for the purposes of a restorative justicerequirement must have regard to any guidance issued from time to time by theSecretary of State with a view to encouraging good practice in connection withsuch an activity.\n\t\tIn this section \u201cvictim\u201d means a victim of, or other person affected by,the offending concerned.\n\tDeferment order: supervisor\n\t\tAppointment of supervisor\n\t\t\tWhere a court makes a deferment order that imposes deferment requirements,it may appoint\u2014\n\t\t\t\tan officer of a provider of probation services, or\n\t\t\t\tany other person the court thinks appropriate who consents to theappointment,\n\t\t\t\t\tto act as a supervisor in relation to the offender.\n\t\tFunction of supervisor\n\t\t\tA supervisor must\u2014\n\t\t\t\tmonitor the offender\u2019s compliance with the deferment requirements, and\n\t\t\t\tprovide the court which deals with the offender for any offence in respectof which the order was made with such information as the court may requirerelating to the offender\u2019s compliance with the deferment requirements.\n\t\tSupervisor appointed under subsection (1)(b): power of magistrates\u2019court to issue summons\n\t\t\tWhere\u2014 \n\t\t\t\ta deferment order imposes deferment requirements,\n\t\t\t\tit falls to a magistrates\u2019 court to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tdeal with the offender for any offence in respect of which the order wasmade, or\n\t\t\t\tdetermine under section 9(3)(b) whether the offender has failed to complywith a deferment requirement, and\n\t\t\t\ta justice of the peace is satisfied that a supervisor appointed undersubsection (1)(b)\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis likely to be able to give evidence that may assist the court in doingso, and\n\t\t\t\twill not voluntarily attend as a witness,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe justice may issue a summons directed to that supervisor requiring thesupervisor to attend before the court at the time and place appointed in thesummons to give evidence.\n\tFailure to comply with deferment requirement\n\t\tThis section applies where\u2014\n\t\t\ta court has made a deferment order that imposes deferment requirements, and\n\t\t\ta supervisor has reported to the court that the offender has failed tocomply with one or more of the deferment requirements.\n\t\tThe court may issue\u2014\n\t\t\ta summons requiring the offender to appear before it at the time and placespecified in the summons, or\n\t\t\ta warrant for the offender\u2019s arrest which requires the offender to bebrought before it at the time and place specified in the warrant.\n\t\tThe court may deal with the offender for the offence in respect of whichthe order was made before the end of the period of deferment if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe offender appears or is brought before the court under subsection (2),and\n\t\t\tthe court is satisfied that the offender has failed to comply with one ormore of the deferment requirements.\n\t\t\t\tFor the powers of the court in dealing with the offender under thissubsection, see section 11.\n\tConviction of offence during period of deferment\n\t\tThis section applies where a court has made a deferment order in respect ofan offence.\n\t\tPower of court which made deferment order\n\t\t\tThe court which made the order (\u201cthe original court\u201d) may deal with theoffender for the offence in respect of which the deferment order was madebefore the end of the period of deferment if during that period the offenderis convicted in Great Britain of any offence.\n\t\t\t\tFor the powers of the original court in dealing with the offender under thissubsection, see section 11.\n\t\t\tWhere the original court proposes to deal with the offender by virtue ofsubsection (2) before the end of the period of deferment, it may issue\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta summons requiring the offender to appear before the court at the time andplace specified in the summons, or\n\t\t\t\ta warrant for the arrest of the offender, requiring the offender to bebrought before the court at the time and place specified in the warrant.\n\t\tPower of court which sentences offender for later offence\n\t\t\tSubsection (5) applies where during the period of deferment the offender isconvicted in England and Wales of any offence (\u201cthe later offence\u201d).\n\t\t\t\tThis is subject to subsection (6).\n\t\t\tThe court which passes sentence on the offender for the later offence mayalso deal with the offender for the offence or offences in respect of whichthe deferment order was made (if this has not already been done).\n\t\t\tFor the powers of the court in dealing with the offender under thissubsection, see section 11.\n\t\t\tSubsection (5) does not apply where\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe deferment order was made by the Crown Court, and\n\t\t\t\tthe court which passes sentence on the offender for the later offence is amagistrates\u2019 court.\n\t\t\tSubsection (5)\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis without prejudice to subsection (2), and\n\t\t\t\tapplies whether or not the offender is sentenced for the later offenceduring the period of deferment.\n\tPowers of court dealing with offender following deferment order\n\t\tSubsection (2) applies where an offender who is subject to a defermentorder is being dealt with for any offence in respect of which the order wasmade\u2014\n\t\t\tby the court which made the order (\u201cthe original court\u201d)\u2014\n\t\t\tat the end of the period of deferment, in accordance with the defermentorder,\n\t\t\tunder section 9(3) (failure to comply with deferment requirement), or\n\t\t\tunder section 10(2) (original court dealing with offender followingconviction during period of deferment), or\n\t\t\tby any court under section 10(5) (conviction during period of deferment:convicting court dealing with offender).\n\t\tThe court may deal with the offender for the offence in any way in whichthe original court could have dealt with the offender for the offence if ithad not made a deferment order.\n\t\tWhere a magistrates\u2019 court is dealing with the offender, its power underthat subsection includes, in particular, the power in section 14 to commit theoffender to the Crown Court for sentence.\n\t\tWhere a magistrates\u2019 court deals with the offender by committing theoffender to the Crown Court under section 14, the power of the Crown Court todeal with the offender includes the same power to make a deferment order as ifthe offender had just been convicted of the offence on indictment before it.\n\tSaving for power to bind over and other powers to defer sentence\n\t\tNothing in this Chapter affects\u2014\n\t\t\tthe power of the Crown Court to bind over an offender to come up forjudgment when called upon, or\n\t\t\tany other power of a court to defer passing sentence.\n\tDeferment orders: interpretation\n\t\tIn this Chapter\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cdeferment requirement\u201d has the meaning given by section 3(2); \n\t\t\t  * \u201cperiod of deferment\u201d, in relation to a deferment order, means the period from

arerelevant to the offender\u2019s case, and\n\t\t\tmust, in exercising any other function relating to the sentencing ofoffenders, follow any sentencing guidelines which are relevant to the exerciseof the function,\n\t\t\t\tunless the court is satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests ofjustice to do so.\n\t\tThe duty imposed by subsection (1) is subject to\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 125(1) (fine must reflect seriousness of offence);\n\t\t\tsection 179(2) (restriction on youth rehabilitation order);\n\t\t\tsection 186(3) and (6) (restrictions on choice of requirements of youthrehabilitation order);\n\t\t\tsection 204(2) (restriction on community order);\n\t\t\tsection 208(3) and (6) (restrictions on choice of requirements of communityorder);\n\t\t\tsection 230 (threshold for imposing discretionary custodial sentence);\n\t\t\tsection 231 (custodial sentence must be for shortest term commensurate withseriousness of offence);\n\t\t\tsections 273 and 283 (life sentence for second listed offence for certaindangerous offenders);\n\t\t\tsection 321 and Schedule 21 (determination of minimum term in relation tomandatory life sentence);\n\t\t\tthe provisions mentioned in section 399(c) (mandatory minimum sentences).\n\t\tNothing in this section or section 60 or 61 is to be taken as restrictingany power (whether under the Mental Health Act 1983 or otherwise) whichenables a court to deal with an offender suffering from a mental disorder inthe manner it considers to be most appropriate in all the circumstances.\n\tSentencing guidelines: determination of sentence\n\t\tThis section applies where\u2014\n\t\t\ta court is deciding what sentence to impose on an offender for an offence,and\n\t\t\toffence-specific guidelines have been issued in relation to the offence.\n\t\tThe principal guidelines duty includes a duty to impose on the offender, inaccordance with the offence-specific guidelines, a sentence which is withinthe offence range.\n\t\tSubsection (2) is subject to\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 73 (reduction in sentences for guilty pleas),\n\t\t\tsections 74, 387 and 388 (assistance by offenders: reduction or review ofsentence) and any other rule of law by virtue of which an offender may receivea discounted sentence in consequence of assistance given (or offered to begiven) by the offender to the prosecutor or investigator of an offence, and\n\t\t\tany rule of law as to the totality of sentences.\n\t\tIf the offence-specific guidelines describe different seriousnesscategories\u2014\n\t\t\tthe principal guidelines duty also includes a duty to decide which of thecategories most resembles the offender\u2019s case in order to identify thesentencing starting point in the offence range, but\n\t\t\tnothing in this section imposes on the court a separate duty to impose asentence which is within the category range.\n\t\tSubsection (4) does not apply if the court is of the opinion that, for thepurpose of identifying the sentence within the offence range which is theappropriate starting point, none of the categories sufficiently resembles theoffender\u2019s case.\n\t\tSubsections (2) and (4) (except as applied by section 61) are subject toany power a court has to impose an extended sentence.\n\tSentencing guidelines: extended sentences and life sentences\n\t\tExtended sentence: determination of appropriate custodial term\n\t\t\tSubsection (2) applies where a court is considering whether to impose anextended sentence for an offence.\n\t\t\tIn determining the appropriate custodial term for the purposes of section256(2), 268(2) or 281(2) (extended sentence for certain violent, sexual orterrorism offences), section 60 applies to the court as it applies to a courtin determining the sentence for an offence.\n\t\tLife sentence for second listed offence: determination of sentencecondition\n\t\t\tSubsection (4) applies where a court is considering whether to impose asentence under section 273 or 283 (life sentence for second listed offence)for an offence.\n\t\t\tIn determining, for the purpose of deciding whether the sentence conditionin section 273(4) or 283(4) is met, the sentence that it would have passed asmentioned in that condition, section 60 applies to the court as it applies toa court in determining the sentence for an offence.\n\t\tNotional determinate term for non-fixed life sentence\n\t\t\tSubsection (6) applies where a court imposes a non-fixed life sentence foran offence.\n\t\t\tSection 60 applies to the court in determining the notional determinateterm in respect of the offence for the purpose of determining the order to bemade under section 323 (minimum term order for non-fixed life sentence).\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (6), the notional determinate term is thedeterminate sentence that would have been passed in respect of the offence ifthe court had not been required by the need to protect the public and thepotential danger of the offender to impose a non-fixed life sentence.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201cnon-fixed life sentence\u201d means\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta sentence of imprisonment for life (other than a sentence fixed by law),\n\t\t\t\ta sentence of detention for life under section 250, or\n\t\t\t\ta sentence of custody for life under section 272.\n\tSentencing guidelines duties: interpretation\n\t\tIn this Chapter\u2014\n\t\t\t  *

under subsection(1)(b) if a parenting order (whether under this Chapter or any otherenactment) has been made in respect of the parent on any previous occasion.\n\t\t\tIf the parenting order provides this in accordance with section 366(7),368(5) or 369(5), a counselling or guidance programme specified undersubsection (1)(b) may be or include a residential course.\n\tParenting order for parent or

theparent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s attendance at a residential course is proportionate inall the circumstances,\n\t\t\t\tthe court may provide in the order that a counselling or guidance programmewhich the parent or guardian is required to attend by virtue of therequirement may be or include a residential course.\n\t\t\tBefore making a parenting order under this section where the
