    "general": "The Local Transport Act 2008 is a law that helps improve the way transportation works in local areas. It makes sure that there are enough buses and other forms of transport available, and that they are run safely and efficiently. The law also helps to make sure that people who use public transport have a say in how it is run. Additionally, the law changes some words and phrases used in previous transport laws to make them easier to understand. Finally, the law allows for better management of traffic and roadworks, and ensures that information about vehicles from other countries is properly handled.",
