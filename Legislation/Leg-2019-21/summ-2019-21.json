    "summary": "The Supply and Appropriation (Main Estimates) Act 2019 allows the government to spend more money on different things for the financial year ending on March 31st, 2020. This includes spending on important things like healthcare, education, and defense. The law says how much money can be spent on these things and where it will come from. For example, most of the money will come from a special fund called the \"Consolidated Fund.\" Some of the money will also come from other sources, like taxes and fees. The law also tells the government how to use any extra money that comes in during the year. So, this law helps the government plan its spending for the next year.",
