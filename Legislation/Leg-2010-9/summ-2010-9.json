    "summary": "The Child Poverty Act of 2010 aims to reduce child poverty in the United Kingdom by setting targets and requiring the government to monitor progress toward meeting those targets. The act defines key terms like \"qualifying household\" and establishes the Child Poverty Commission to oversee efforts to reduce child poverty. The commission will have various functions, including monitoring progress and making recommendations to the government. Additionally, the act requires the government to create a plan every three years to reduce child poverty, which must include measures to improve employment opportunities, provide financial support, promote parenting skills, and address physical and mental health, education, and social inclusion. The act also requires local authorities in England to work together to reduce child poverty in their areas. Finally, the act makes amendments to free school meals and milk programs for children in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland."
