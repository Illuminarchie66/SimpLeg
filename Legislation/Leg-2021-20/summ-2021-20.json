    "summary": "The Education (Guidance about Costs of School Uniforms) Act 2021 helps ensure that schools in England provide clear information about the costs of their uniform policies. This includes details on the prices of different items, how often they need to be replaced, and any financial assistance available to families. The law also requires schools to consider this guidance when making decisions about their uniform policies. This means that parents will have a better understanding of the costs involved and can make more informed choices about their child's education. Additionally, the government can update the guidance whenever necessary to reflect changes in the cost of living or other factors affecting school uniforms. Overall, the purpose of this act is to promote transparency and fairness in school uniform policies, so that every student has access to quality education regardless of their family's financial situation.",
