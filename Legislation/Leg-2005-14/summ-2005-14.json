    "summary": "The Railways Act 2005 simplifies the regulation of UK railways by consolidating multiple agencies into one office, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR). This change aims to improve railway service performance, protect user interests, and ensure better value for public funding. Additionally, the act provides financial assistance for railway services, allowing the UK government to support the development and improvement of railway infrastructure and services.\nFor railway stations, the act outlines a specific process for their closure or modification. Proposed closures or modifications must meet certain criteria, such as minimizing the impact on passengers and ensuring financial viability. During an interim period, the national authority must maintain the station's operations while the proposal is under review. Ultimately, the decision to close or modify a station rests with the national authority, subject to review by the Office of Rail Regulation."
