The act also creates a process for people to file complaints about poor service from legal providers, and establishes an office to handle these complaints. Additionally, the act makes changes to the way that legal aid is provided, and expands the types of services that are eligible for legal aid funding. It also includes provisions related to immigration advice and services, as well as the provision of free legal representation. Overall, the purpose of the Legal Services Act 2007 is to ensure that legal services are delivered in a fair and transparent manner, and to protect consumers from substandard or dishonest legal providers.",
