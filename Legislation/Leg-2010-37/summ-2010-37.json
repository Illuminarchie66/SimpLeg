    "summary": "The Superannuation Act 2010 is a law that affects civil servants who lose their jobs. It limits the amount of money they can receive as compensation and introduces new rules for changing the compensation scheme. Before making any changes, the government must talk to the affected employees and report any reductions in compensation to Parliament. The law also explains how the amount of compensation is calculated and lists the types of losses that are not covered. The government has the power to make some changes to the law through orders, but these must be approved by the House of Commons.\nPlease note that the above output is just one example of how the text could be summarized, there might be other ways to simplify the text as well.",
