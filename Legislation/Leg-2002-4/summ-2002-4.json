    "general": "This act makes changes to when people can get discounts on buses, trains, and other forms of public transportation based on their age. Before this act was passed, there were specific ages at which people became eligible for these discounts. This act changes those ages so more people can get discounts. For example, if you are 65 years old instead of 60 years old, you might be able to get a discount on your train ticket now. The goal of this act is to make it easier for older people to travel around by making these discounts available to more people.",

    "summary": "The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Act 2002 changes when older people can get cheaper travel passes for buses and trains. Before, people could get them when they were 60 years old. Now, they have to wait until they reach the pension age, which is currently 65 for men and 62 for women. This means that more people will have to pay more for their travel. The new rules apply to both men and women and will start on April 6, 2010. The government can choose when different parts of the law will start by making special laws called \"statutory instruments.\" This law only applies to England and Wales.",
