    "general": "This law allows the government to spend money from the country's budget for the years 2005 and 2006. It also takes money from the Consolidated Fund to pay for these expenses. The fund is like a special account that holds all the money that the government collects through taxes and other means. This law says how much money can be spent on different things, like healthcare, education, and defense. It also makes sure that there is enough money available to cover all the expenses for those two years.",
