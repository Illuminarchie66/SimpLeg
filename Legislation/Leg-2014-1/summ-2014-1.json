    "general": "This law helps people who have an illness called mesothelioma, which is caused by asbestos. It sets up a special fund to pay compensation to those who are sick and can't work because of this disease. The law also makes it easier for people to get money from their insurance companies if they were exposed to asbestos at work or in other situations. This way, people with mesothelioma can focus on getting better instead of worrying about how they will pay their bills.",

The scheme administrator assists claimants in taking legal action against their employers or insurers. The UK government gathers funds for the payment plan through an insurance levy. The Technical Committee resolves insurance conflicts, and the arbitration process binds both sides unless appealed. Regulations can change the system, and the law applies throughout England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland."
