    "summary": "The Taxation of Pensions Act 2014 helps people over 75 access their pension savings more easily. It lets them take out money from their pensions without facing big tax penalties. This means they can use their pension savings to pay bills, help family members, or enjoy retirement. The law also makes it easier for people to buy annuities, which provide a steady income stream in retirement. Additionally, the law lowers taxes on some lump sums paid by pension schemes when someone passes away after reaching age 75. These changes aim to give people more control over their retirement savings and make it easier for them to live comfortably in their golden years.",
