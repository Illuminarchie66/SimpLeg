    "general": "This law helps protect important cultural items like historical objects, artwork, and religious artifacts during wars. It makes sure these items are not stolen or destroyed by armies fighting in countries where these items exist. The law allows the UK to follow an international agreement called the Hague Convention which sets out rules to protect cultural property during conflicts. This means that if the UK goes to war with another country, they will have to be careful not to damage or steal important cultural items.",
