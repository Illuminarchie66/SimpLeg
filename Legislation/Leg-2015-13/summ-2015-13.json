    "general": "This act allows friendly societies (like building societies) and some mutual insurance companies to create special type of shares called \"deferred shares\". These shares can only be given to existing members, and they don't have any voting rights. This means that these members can still be part of the society/company but they won't have a say in how it's run. The purpose of this act is to help these organizations raise more money from their members without giving up control.",

    "summary": "The Mutuals' Deferred Shares Act 2015 lets friendly societies and some insurance companies issue special shares called \"deferred shares.\" These shares have limited voting power, meaning they don't give their owners as much say in how the company is run compared to regular shares. This law helps these groups raise money without giving too much control to the people who buy these special shares. The government can also make rules to help these groups issue these shares and make sure they follow certain guidelines. Overall, this law helps friendly societies and mutual insurers stay independent and focused on serving their members rather than outside investors.",
