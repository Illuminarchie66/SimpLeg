It allows them to close certain places, like schools and hospitals, if they need to be cleaned or fixed. It also lets the government tell people what to do to stay safe during the pandemic. For example, it might say that people should wear masks when they go outside or that they shouldn't go to big gatherings. The law also gives the government money to help pay for things like medical care and food for people who are affected by the virus.",
