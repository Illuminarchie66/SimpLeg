    "summary": "The Cultural Objects (Protection from Seizure) Act 2022 helps protect important cultural items like artwork or historical artifacts that are on loan to museums or galleries in England or Scotland. This law extends the time these items can be protected from being taken away or seized, from 12 months to up to 3 extra months if they're part of a temporary exhibition. This means the item will be protected for a longer period of time, giving people more chances to see and enjoy them. Additionally, the government has the power to extend this protection multiple times for the same item, so long as it remains on display. Finally, the law ensures that references to the United Kingdom in the original act apply to either England or Scotland, depending on where the item is being shown.",
