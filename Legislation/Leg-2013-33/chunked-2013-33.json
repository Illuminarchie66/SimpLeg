an infrastructure company, and\n\t\t\tdirects that, while the order is in force, the affairs, business andproperty of the company are to be managed by a person appointed by the court.\n\t\tA person appointed as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) is referred to in thisPart as an FMI administrator.\n\t\tThe FMI administrator of a company must manage its affairs, business andproperty, and exercise and perform the FMI administrator\u2019s functions, so as toachieve the objective in section 115.\n\tObjective of FMI administration\n\t\tWhere an FMI administrator is appointed in relation to the operator of arecognised inter-bank payment system or a securities settlement system, theobjective of the FMI administration is\u2014\n\t\t\tto ensure that the system is and continues to be maintained and operated asan efficient and effective system,\n\t\t\twhere the operator of the system is also a clearing house falling withinsection 285(1)(b)(ii) of FSMA 2000 (recognised clearing house that is not arecognised central counterparty), to ensure that the protected activitiescontinue to be carried on, and\n\t\t\tto ensure by one or both of the specified means that it becomes unnecessaryfor the FMI administration order to remain in force for that purpose or thosepurposes.\n\t\tWhere an FMI administrator is appointed in relation to a company designatedunder subsection (4) of section 112, the objective of the FMI administrationis\u2014\n\t\t\tto ensure that services falling within that subsection continue to beprovided, and\n\t\t\tto ensure by one or both of the specified means that it becomes unnecessaryfor the FMI administration order to remain in force for that purpose.\n\t\tThe protected activities referred to in subsection (1)(b) are suchactivities as the Bank of England may from time to time direct, which must be\u2014\n\t\t\tregulated activities falling within section 285(3)(a) or (b) of FSMA 2000,or\n\t\t\trelated activities which are necessary for the efficient carrying on of anyof those regulated activities.\n\t\tThe specified means are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe rescue as a going concern of the company subject to the FMIadministration order, and\n\t\t\ttransfers falling within subsection (5).\n\t\tA transfer falls within this subsection if it is a transfer as a goingconcern\u2014\n\t\t\tto another company, or\n\t\t\tas respects different parts of the undertaking of the company subject tothe FMI administration order, to two or more different companies,\n\t\t\t\tof so much of that undertaking as it is appropriate to transfer for thepurpose of achieving the objective of the FMI administration.\n\t\tThe means by which transfers falling within subsection (5) may be effectedinclude, in particular\u2014\n\t\t\ta transfer of the undertaking of the company subject to the FMIadministration order, or of part of its undertaking, to a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of that company, and\n\t\t\tthe transfer to a company of securities of a wholly-owned subsidiary towhich there has been a transfer falling within paragraph (a).\n\t\tThe objective of the FMI administration may be achieved by transfersfalling within subsection (5) only to the extent that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe rescue as a going concern of the company subject to the FMIadministration order is not reasonably practicable or is not reasonablypracticable without such transfers,\n\t\t\tthe rescue of that company as a going concern will not achieve thatobjective or will not do so without such transfers, or\n\t\t\tsuch transfers would produce a result for the company\u2019s creditors as awhole that is better than the result that would be produced without them.\n\tApplication for FMI administration order\n\t\tAn application for an FMI administration order may be made to the court bythe Bank of England.\n\t\tAn application must nominate a person to be appointed as the FMIadministrator.\n\t\tThe infrastructure company must be given notice of an application, inaccordance with rules under section 411 of the 1986 Act (as applied inrelation to FMI administration).\n\tPowers of court\n\t\tThe court may make an FMI administration order in relation to aninfrastructure company if satisfied\u2014\n\t\t\tthat the company is unable to pay its debts,\n\t\t\tthat the company is likely to be unable to pay its debts, or\n\t\t\tthat, on a petition presented by the Secretary of State under section 124Aof the 1986 Act (petition for winding up on grounds of public interest), itwould be just and equitable (disregarding the objective of the FMIadministration) to wind up the company.\n\t\tThe court may not make an FMI administration order on the ground set out insubsection (1)(c) unless the Secretary of State has certified to the courtthat the case is one in which the Secretary of State considers (disregardingthe objective of the FMI administration) that it would be appropriate topetition under section 124A of the 1986 Act.\n\t\tOn an application for an FMI administration order, the court may\u2014\n\t\t\tgrant the application;\n\t\t\tdismiss the application;\n\t\t\tadjourn the application (generally or to a specified date);\n\t\t\tmake an interim order;\n\t\t\ttreat the application as a winding-up petition and make any order which thecourt could make under section 125 of the 1986 Act;\n\t\t\tmake any other order which the court thinks appropriate.\n\t\tAn interim order under subsection (3)(d) may, in particular\u2014\n\t\t\trestrict the exercise of a power of the company or of its directors;\n\t\t\tmake provision conferring a discretion on the court or on a personqualified to act as an insolvency practitioner in relation to the company.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section a company is unable to pay its debts if itis treated as being so unable under section 123 of the 1986 Act (definition ofinability to pay debts).\n\tFMI administrators\n\t\tThe FMI administrator of a company\u2014\n\t\t\tis an officer of the court, and\n\t\t\tin exercising and performing powers and duties in relation to the company,is the company\u2019s agent.\n\t\tThe management by the FMI administrator of a company of any of its affairs,business or property must be carried out for the purpose of achieving theobjective of the FMI administration as quickly and efficiently as isreasonably practicable.\n\t\tThe FMI administrator of a company must exercise and perform powers andduties in the way which, so far as it is consistent with the objective of theFMI administration to do so, best protects\u2014\n\t\t\tthe interests of the company\u2019s creditors as a whole, and\n\t\t\tsubject to those interests, the interests of the company\u2019s members as awhole.\n\tContinuity of supply\n\t\tThis section applies where, before the commencement of FMI administration,the infrastructure company had entered into arrangements with a supplier forthe provision of a supply to the infrastructure company.\n\t\tAfter the commencement of FMI administration, the supplier\u2014\n\t\t\tmust not terminate a supply unless\u2014\n\t\t\tany charges in respect of the supply which relate to a supply given afterthe commencement of FMI administration remain unpaid for more than 28 days,\n\t\t\tthe FMI administrator consents to the termination, or\n\t\t\tthe supplier has the permission of the court, which may be given if thesupplier can show that the continued provision of the supply would cause thesupplier to suffer hardship,\n\t\t\tmust not make it a condition of a supply that any charges in respect of thesupply which relate to a supply given before the commencement of FMIadministration are paid, and\n\t\t\tmust not do anything which has the effect of making it a condition of thegiving of a supply that any charges within paragraph (b) are paid.\n\t\tWhere, before the commencement of FMI administration, a contractual rightto terminate a supply has arisen but has not been exercised, then, for thepurposes of this section, the commencement of FMI administration causes thatright to lapse and the supply is only to be terminated if a ground insubsection (2)(a) applies.\n\t\tAny provision in a contract between the infrastructure company and thesupplier that purports to terminate the agreement if any action is taken toput the infrastructure company in FMI administration is void.\n\t\tAny expenses incurred by the infrastructure company on the provision of asupply after the commencement of FMI administration are to be treated asnecessary disbursements in the course of the FMI administration.\n\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201ccommencement of FMI administration\u201d means the making of the FMI administration order; \n\t\t\t  * \u201csupplier\u201d means the person controlling the provision of a supply to the infrastructure company, and includes a company that is a group undertaking (as defined by section 1161(5) of the Companies Act 2006) in respect of the infrastructure company; \n\t\t\t  * \u201csupply\u201d means a supply of any of the following\u2014 \n\t\t\tcomputer hardware or software used by the infrastructure company in connectionwith the operation of the relevant system;\n\t\t\tfinancial data;\n\t\t\tinfrastructure permitting electronic communication services;\n\t\t\tdata processing;\n\t\t\taccess to secure data networks used by the infrastructure company inconnection with the operation of the relevant system;\n\t\t\tstaff.\n\tPower to direct FMI administrator\n\t\tIf the Bank of England considers it necessary to do so for the purpose ofachieving the objective of an FMI administration, the Bank may direct the FMIadministrator to take, or refrain from taking, specified action.\n\t\tIn deciding whether to give a direction under this section, the Bank ofEngland must have regard to the public interest in\u2014\n\t\t\tthe protection and enhancement of the stability of the financial system ofthe United Kingdom, and\n\t\t\tthe maintenance of public confidence in that system.\n\t\tA direction under this section must not be incompatible with a direction ofthe court that is in force under Schedule B1 to the 1986 Act.\n\t\tThe Bank of England must, within a reasonable time of giving the direction,give the FMI administrator a statement of its reasons for giving thedirection.\n\t\tA person listed in subsection (6) has immunity from liability in damages inrespect of action or inaction in accordance with a direction under thissection.\n\t\tThose persons are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe FMI administrator;\n\t\t\tthe company in FMI administration;\n\t\t\tthe officers or staff of the company.\n\t\tImmunity conferred by this section does not extend to action or inaction\u2014\n\t\t\tin bad faith, or\n\t\t\tin contravention of section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998.\n\t\tThis section does not limit the powers conferred on the Bank of England bysection 191 of the Banking Act 2009 (directions) in relation to a recognisedinter-bank payment system.\n\tConduct of administration, transfer schemes etc.\n\t\tSchedule 6 (which applies the provisions of Schedule B1 to the 1986 Actabout ordinary administration orders and certain other enactments to FMIadministration orders) has effect.\n\t\tSchedule 7 (which makes provision for transfer schemes to achieve theobjective of an FMI administration) has effect.\n\t\tThe power to make rules conferred by section 411(1B) of the 1986 Act (rulesrelating to bank administration) is to apply for the purpose of giving effectto this Part as it applies for the purposes of giving effect to Part 3 of theBanking Act 2009 (and, accordingly, as if the reference in section 411(1B) tothat Part included a reference to this Part)."
