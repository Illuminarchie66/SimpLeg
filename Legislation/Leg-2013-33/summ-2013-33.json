The act gives the FSCS the power to require information from the scheme manager and discharge its functions efficiently and effectively while minimizing public expenditure.\n* Simplified point 5: The act also makes changes to the way the FSCS is managed, including the appointment of an accounting officer and the requirement for the scheme manager to provide information to the Treasury.

It creates a new framework for the administration of critical infrastructure companies in the financial sector, including the appointment of an FMI administrator to manage the company's operations and ensure uninterrupted delivery of vital services. The Act gives the FMI administrator the power to take certain actions to achieve the objective of the administration, such as borrowing money and indemnifying individuals against liabilities and losses sustained while exercising their powers and obligations as FMI administrators. Additionally, the Act allows for the creation of rules limiting customer exposure to excessive loan charges when obtaining high-interest, short-term loans. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) must establish rules limiting customers' exposure to exorbitant loan charges when obtaining high-interest, short-term loans. The CA must ensure that any rules created as a result of this legislation are in place by January 2, 2015, and apply to agreements entered into on or after that date. The part defines key terms used in the rest of the act, including \"business\", \"member\", \"property\", \"security\", \"company\", \"court\", and references to Northern Ireland\". The act grants additional powers to promote competition in financial markets, protect consumers, and enhance the stability of the financial system."
