are qualifying benefits.\n\tQualifying benefits\n\t\tA benefit provided under a pension scheme is a \u201cqualifying benefit\u201d if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe benefit is provided out of the available assets of the scheme,\n\t\t\tunder the rules of the scheme, the rate or amount of the benefit is subjectto periodic adjustments designed to achieve a balance between the value of theavailable assets of the scheme and the required amount, and\n\t\t\tthe benefit is not of a description specified in regulations made by theSecretary of State.\n\t\tIn subsection (1)\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe available assets of the scheme\u201d means all the assets that\u2014 \n\t\t\tarise or derive from the payments made by or in respect of members of thescheme, and\n\t\t\tare available (subject to any deductions that fall to be made in respect ofadministration charges) for the provision of benefits to or in respect of themembers of the scheme collectively;\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cthe required amount\u201d means the amount expected to be required, applying appropriate actuarial assumptions, for the purpose of providing benefits under the scheme to or in respect of the members of the scheme collectively. \n\t\tRegulations under subsection (1)(c) are subject to affirmative resolutionprocedure.\n\t\tWhere a scheme is divided into sections, this section has effect as if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe reference to the scheme in subsection (1)(a) were a reference to asection of the scheme, and\n\t\t\tthe other references to the scheme were references to that section of it.\n\tQualifying schemes\n\t\tA pension scheme is a \u201cqualifying scheme\u201d if it meets the requirements inthis section.\n\t\tThe scheme must be an occupational pension scheme established under anirrevocable trust by a person or persons to whom section 1(2)(a) (employer) ofthe Pension Schemes Act 1993 applied when the scheme was established (withoutother persons).\n\t\tThe scheme must be used, or intended to be used, only by\u2014\n\t\t\ta single employer, or\n\t\t\ttwo or more employers that are connected with each other.\n\t\tThe scheme must not be a relevant public service pension scheme (seesection 4).\n\t\tThe qualifying benefits provided under the scheme must consist of orinclude the payment of a pension.\n\t\tIf the scheme provides both qualifying benefits and other benefits, theremust be appropriate separation of the qualifying benefits.\n\t\tThere is \u201cappropriate separation\u201d of qualifying benefits and other benefitsif (and only if)\u2014\n\t\t\tthe scheme is divided into sections,\n\t\t\tnone of the sections under which qualifying benefits are provided providesother types of benefit,\n\t\t\tpayments made by or in respect of members of the scheme for the purpose ofproviding qualifying benefits under a section of the scheme are allocated tothat section, and\n\t\t\ta proportion of the assets of the scheme is attributable to each section ofthe scheme and cannot be used for the purposes of any other section.\n\t\tIf the scheme provides a combination of qualifying benefits with differentcharacteristics that is described in regulations made by the Secretary ofState, there must be appropriate separation of those qualifying benefits.\n\t\tThere is \u201cappropriate separation\u201d of qualifying benefits with differentcharacteristics if (and only if)\u2014\n\t\t\tthe scheme is divided into sections,\n\t\t\teach of the different types of qualifying benefit is provided under adifferent section,\n\t\t\tpayments made by or in respect of members of the scheme for the purpose ofproviding qualifying benefits under a section of the scheme are allocated tothat section, and\n\t\t\ta proportion of the assets of the scheme is attributable to each section ofthe scheme and cannot be used for the purposes of any other section.\n\t\tRegulations under subsection (8) are subject to negative resolutionprocedure.\n\tQualifying schemes: supplementary\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 3(4) a pension scheme is a relevant publicservice pension scheme if it is\u2014\n\t\t\ta public service pension scheme within the meaning of the Pension SchemesAct 1993 (see section 1(1) of that Act),\n\t\t\ta scheme under section 1 of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (newpublic service schemes),\n\t\t\ta new public body pension scheme as defined in section 30 of that Act, or\n\t\t\ta statutory pension scheme that is connected with a scheme referred to inparagraph (b) or (c).\n\t\tIn subsection (1)(d) \u201cconnected\u201d and \u201cstatutory pension scheme\u201d have thesame meaning as in the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (see sections 4(6) and37 of that Act).\n\t\tThe reference to a pension in section 3(5) does not include incomewithdrawal or dependants\u2019 income withdrawal within the meaning of paragraphs 7and 21 of Schedule 28 to the Finance Act 2004.\n\tSchemes divided into sections\n\t\tThe Secretary of State may by regulations make provision about when apension scheme is or is not divided into sections for the purposes of thisPart.\n\t\tThe Secretary of State may by regulations provide that, where a collectivemoney purchase scheme that is not divided into sections (an \u201cundividedscheme\u201d) becomes a collective money purchase scheme that is divided intosections, an authorisation previously granted in respect of the undividedscheme applies to any of those sections that\u2014\n\t\t\tis a collective money purchase scheme by reason of section 1(2)(b), and\n\t\t\tsatisfies conditions specified in the regulations.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Part, where\u2014\n\t\t\ta qualifying scheme is divided into sections, and\n\t\t\teach of those sections is a collective money purchase scheme by reason ofsection 1(2)(b),\n\t\t\t\tthe qualifying scheme (taken as a whole) is to be treated as if it were not acollective money purchase scheme.\n\t\tRegulations under subsection (1) are
