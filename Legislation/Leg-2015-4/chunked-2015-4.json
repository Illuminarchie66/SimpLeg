variations of non-consumer insurancecontracts as it applies to contracts, but\u2014\n\t\t\treferences to the risk are to be read as references to changes in the riskrelevant to the proposed variation, and\n\t\t\treferences to the contract of insurance are to the variation.\n\tThe duty of fair presentation\n\t\tBefore a contract of insurance is entered into, the insured must make tothe insurer a fair presentation of the risk.\n\t\tThe duty imposed by subsection (1) is referred to in this Act as \u201cthe dutyof fair presentation\u201d.\n\t\tA fair presentation of the risk is one\u2014\n\t\t\twhich makes the disclosure required by subsection (4),\n\t\t\twhich makes that disclosure in a manner which would be reasonably clear andaccessible to a prudent insurer, and\n\t\t\tin which every material representation as to a matter of fact issubstantially correct, and every material representation as to a matter ofexpectation or belief is made in good faith.\n\t\tThe disclosure required is as follows, except as provided in subsection(5)\u2014\n\t\t\tdisclosure of every material circumstance which the insured knows or oughtto know, or\n\t\t\tfailing that, disclosure which gives the insurer sufficient information toput a prudent insurer on notice that it needs to make further enquiries forthe purpose of revealing those material circumstances.\n\t\tIn the absence of enquiry, subsection (4) does not require the insured todisclose a circumstance if\u2014\n\t\t\tit diminishes the risk,\n\t\t\tthe insurer knows it,\n\t\t\tthe insurer ought to know it,\n\t\t\tthe insurer is presumed to know it, or\n\t\t\tit is something as to which the insurer waives information.\n\t\tSections 4 to 6 make further provision about the knowledge of the insuredand of the insurer, and section 7 contains supplementary provision.\n\tKnowledge of insured\n\t\tThis section provides for what an insured knows or ought to know for thepurposes of section 3(4)(a).\n\t\tAn insured who is an individual knows only\u2014\n\t\t\twhat is known to the individual, and\n\t\t\twhat is known to one or more of the individuals who are responsible for theinsured\u2019s insurance.\n\t\tAn insured who is not an individual knows only what is known to one or moreof the individuals who are\u2014\n\t\t\tpart of the insured\u2019s senior management, or\n\t\t\tresponsible for the insured\u2019s insurance.\n\t\tAn insured is not by virtue of subsection (2)(b) or (3)(b) taken to knowconfidential information known to an individual if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe individual is, or is an employee of, the insured\u2019s agent; and\n\t\t\tthe information was acquired by the insured\u2019s agent (or by an employee ofthat agent) through a business relationship with a person who is not connectedwith the contract of insurance.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (4) the persons connected with a contract ofinsurance are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe insured and any other persons for whom cover is provided by thecontract, and\n\t\t\tif the contract re-insures risks covered by another contract, the personswho are (by virtue of this subsection) connected with that other contract.\n\t\tWhether an individual or not, an insured ought to know what shouldreasonably have been revealed by a reasonable search of information availableto the insured (whether the search is conducted by making enquiries or by anyother means).\n\t\tIn subsection (6) \u201cinformation\u201d includes information held within theinsured\u2019s organisation or by any other person (such as the insured\u2019s agent ora person for whom cover is provided by the contract of insurance).\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\u201cemployee\u201d, in relation to the insured\u2019s agent, includes any individualworking for the agent, whatever the capacity in which the individual acts,\n\t\t\tan individual is responsible for the insured\u2019s insurance if the individualparticipates on behalf of the insured in the process of procuring theinsured\u2019s insurance (whether the individual does so as the insured\u2019s employeeor agent, as an employee of the insured\u2019s agent or in any other capacity), and\n\t\t\t\u201csenior management\u201d means those individuals who play significant roles inthe making of decisions about how the insured\u2019s activities are to be managedor organised.\n\tKnowledge of insurer\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 3(5)(b), an insurer knows something only if itis known to one or more of the individuals who participate on behalf of theinsurer in the decision whether to take the risk, and if so on what terms(whether the individual does so as the insurer\u2019s employee or agent, as anemployee of the insurer\u2019s agent or in any other capacity).\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 3(5)(c), an insurer ought to know somethingonly if\u2014\n\t\t\tan employee or agent of the insurer knows it, and ought reasonably to havepassed on the relevant information to an individual mentioned in subsection(1), or\n\t\t\tthe relevant information is held by the insurer and is readily available toan individual mentioned in subsection (1).\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 3(5)(d), an insurer is presumed to know\u2014\n\t\t\tthings which are common knowledge, and\n\t\t\tthings which an insurer offering insurance of the class in question toinsureds in the field of activity in question would reasonably be expected toknow in the ordinary course of business.\n\tKnowledge: general\n\t\tFor the purposes of sections 3 to 5, references to an individual\u2019sknowledge include not only actual knowledge, but also matters which theindividual suspected, and of which the individual would have had knowledge butfor deliberately refraining from confirming them or enquiring about them.\n\t\tNothing in this Part affects the operation of any rule of law according towhich knowledge of a fraud perpetrated by an individual (\u201cF\u201d) either on theinsured or on the insurer is not to be attributed to the insured or to theinsurer (respectively), where\u2014\n\t\t\tif the fraud is on the insured, F is any of the individuals mentioned insection 4(2)(b) or (3), or\n\t\t\tif the fraud is on the insurer, F is any of the individuals mentioned insection 5(1).\n\tSupplementary \n\t\tA fair presentation need not be contained in only one document or oralpresentation.\n\t\tThe term \u201ccircumstance\u201d includes any communication made to, or informationreceived by, the insured.\n\t\tA circumstance or representation is material if it would influence thejudgement of a prudent insurer in determining whether to take the risk and, ifso, on what terms.\n\t\tExamples of things which may be material circumstances are\u2014\n\t\t\tspecial or unusual facts relating to the risk,\n\t\t\tany particular concerns which led the insured to seek insurance cover forthe risk,\n\t\t\tanything which those concerned with the class of insurance and field ofactivity in question would generally understand as being something that shouldbe dealt with in a fair presentation of risks of the type in question.\n\t\tA material representation is substantially correct if a prudent insurerwould not consider the difference between what is represented and what isactually correct to be material.\n\t\tA representation may be withdrawn or corrected before the contract ofinsurance is entered into.\n\tRemedies for breach\n\t\tThe insurer has a remedy against the insured for a breach of the duty offair presentation only if the insurer shows that, but for the breach, theinsurer\u2014\n\t\t\twould not have entered into the contract of insurance at all, or\n\t\t\twould have done so only on different terms.\n\t\tThe remedies are set out in Schedule 1.\n\t\tA breach for which the insurer has a remedy against the insured is referredto in this Act as a \u201cqualifying breach\u201d.\n\t\tA qualifying breach is either\u2014\n\t\t\tdeliberate or reckless, or\n\t\t\tneither deliberate nor reckless.\n\t\tA qualifying breach is deliberate or reckless if the insured \u2014\n\t\t\tknew that it was in breach of the duty of fair presentation, or\n\t\t\tdid not care whether or not it was in breach of that duty.\n\t\tIt is for the insurer to show that a qualifying breach was deliberate orreckless."
