    "summary": "The Northern Ireland Act 2009 changes how judges are appointed and removed in Northern Ireland. Before, the Lord Chancellor was responsible for these decisions, but now the Northern Ireland Judicial Appointments Commission will handle them instead. This law also sets up a process for reviewing how judges are chosen and taken out of their positions. Additionally, the law makes some smaller changes to other laws that relate to jury trials and the court system in Northern Ireland. Finally, the law explains how it will be referred to, how it will apply to different parts of the country, when it will start being used, and gives the government extra powers if needed.",
