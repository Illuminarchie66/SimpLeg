    "general": "This law makes it illegal for doctors to put an embryo made from cells into a woman's womb if those cells were not fertilized by sperm. This means that doctors cannot use cloning techniques to create a baby. It also means that any embryos created using these techniques must be destroyed, rather than being implanted in a woman's womb. The purpose of this law is to prevent the creation of genetically identical copies of humans through reproductive cloning.",

    "summary": "The Human Reproductive Cloning Act of 2001 makes it illegal to put a human embryo made in a lab into a woman's body without her permission. This law applies to all women in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. If someone breaks this law, they could go to jail for up to ten years or have to pay a fine. Before anyone can be charged with breaking this law, the government needs to give its okay. This law also covers the Channel Islands, but with some changes and exceptions.\nPlease note that I am just an AI and my understanding of the legal context may not be perfect. Please consult a qualified legal professional if you need specific advice on this topic.",

This bill also makes it illegal to place that embryo into a woman's womb. If someone is found guilty of breaking this law, they could be sent to prison for up to 10 years or fined, or both. This law only applies to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, but the government can make changes to the law to apply it to the Channel Islands."
