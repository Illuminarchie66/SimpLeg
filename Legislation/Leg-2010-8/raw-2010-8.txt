qualifying expenditure is determinedby the formula—, [![](/ukpga/2010/8/images/ukpga_20100008_en_029)](/ukpga/2010/8/images/ukpga_20100008_en_029?view=plain), where—,   * A is the reimbursement expenditure incurred in the tax year,,   * B is so much of the expenditure represented by the guarantee payment as, had it been incurred by the relevant participator, would have been taken into account (by way of capital allowance or a deduction) in calculating the relevant participator’s ring fence income, and,   * C is the total of the sums which, at or before the end of the tax year, the relevant participator is or has become liable to pay to the guarantor as mentioned in subsection (1)(b)., But this is subject to subsection (5)., (5)In relation to the guarantee payment, the total of the reimbursementexpenditure (whenever incurred) which constitutes qualifying expenditure maynot exceed whichever is the less of B and C in subsection (4)., (6)Any limitation on qualifying expenditure under subsection (5) is to beapplied to the expenditure of a later tax year in preference to an earlierone., (7)For the purposes of this section, the expenditure represented by theguarantee payment is any expenditure—, (a)for which the relevant participator is liable, and, (b)which is met, directly or indirectly, out of the guarantee payment (andwhich, accordingly, because of section 225N(4) is not to be regarded asexpenditure incurred by the relevant participator)., (8)See also—, (a)section 225P (payment under abandonment guarantee not immediately applied),and, (b)section 225Q which excludes

account., (2)The references in sections 225N(4) and 225O(7) to expenditure which is met,directly or indirectly, out of the payment are to be read as references to somuch of the expenditure for which the relevant participator is liable as ismet out of those assets of the fund or account which, at the subsequent timementioned in subsection (1)(c), it is just and reasonable to attribute to thepayment., ##### 225QAmounts excluded from section 225O(1), (1)This section applies if—, (a)the whole of the guarantee payment mentioned in section 225O, or of theassets which under section 225P are attributed to the guarantee payment, isnot applied in meeting liabilities of the relevant participator so mentionedwhich fall within section 104(1)(a) and (b) of FA 1991, and, (b)a sum representing the unapplied part of the guarantee payment or of thoseassets is repaid, directly or indirectly, to the guarantor so mentioned., (2)Any liability of the relevant participator to repay that sum is to beexcluded in determining the total liability of the relevant participator whichfalls within section 225O(1)(b)., (3)The repayment to the guarantor of that sum is not to be regarded asexpenditure incurred by the relevant participator as mentioned in section225O(1)(c)., #### Abandonment expenditure, ##### 225RIntroduction to sections 225S and 225T, (1)Sections 225S and 225T apply if—,

allowance, or a deduction in calculating ringfence income, is to be available to the contributing participator in respectof the additional abandonment expenditure if any such relief or deductionwould have been available to the defaulter if—, (a)the defaulter had incurred the additional abandonment expenditure, and, (b)at the time that that expenditure was incurred the defaulter continued tocarry on a ring fence trade., (2)The basis of qualification for or entitlement to any relief or deductionwhich is available to the contributing participator under this section is tobe determined on the assumption that the conditions in subsection (1)(a) and(b) are met., (3)But, subject to subsection (2), any such relief or deduction is to beavailable in the same way as if the additional abandonment expenditure hadbeen incurred by the contributing participator for the purposes of the ringfence trade carried on by the contributing participator., ##### 225TReimbursement by defaulter in respect of certain abandonmentexpenditure, (1)This section applies if expenditure is incurred, or consideration inmoney’s worth is given, by the defaulter in reimbursing the contributingparticipator in respect of, or otherwise making good to the contributingparticipator, the whole or any part of the default payment., (2)In this section “reimbursement expenditure” means expenditure incurred asmentioned in subsection (1) or consideration (or the value of consideration)given as so mentioned; and any reference to the incurring of reimbursementexpenditure is to be read accordingly., (3)Reimbursement expenditure is to be allowed as a deduction in calculatingthe defaulter’s ring fence income (but this is subject to subsection (6))., (4)Reimbursement expenditure received by the contributing participator is tobe treated as a receipt (in the nature of income) of the participator’s ringfence trade for the relevant tax year (but this is subject to subsection (6))., (5)Any additional assessment to income tax required in order to take accountof the receipt of reimbursement expenditure by the contributing participatormay be made at any time not later than 4 years after the end of the calendaryear in which the reimbursement expenditure is so received., (6)In relation to a particular default payment, reimbursement expenditureincurred at any time—, (a)is to be allowed as mentioned in subsection (3), and, (b)is to be taken into account as a result of subsection (4) in calculatingthe contributing participator’s ring fence income,, only so far as, when aggregated with any reimbursement expenditure previouslyincurred in respect of that default payment, it does not exceed so much of thedefault payment as falls to be attributed to the contributing participator asmentioned in section 225R(1)(b)., (7)The incurring of reimbursement expenditure is not to be regarded, by virtueof section 532 of CAA 2001 (the general rule excluding contributions), as themeeting of the expenditure of the contributing participator in making thedefault payment., (8)In subsection (4) “the relevant tax year” means—, (a)the tax year in which the reimbursement expenditure is received by thecontributing participator, or, (b)if the contributing participator’s ring fence trade is permanentlydiscontinued before the receipt of the reimbursement expenditure, the last taxyear in

earnings for the period., (2)The amount of the normal rental excess for that period is equal to thatexcess., (3)But if the taxable rent for the period is reduced under section 614BI(reduction of taxable rent by the cumulative accountancy rental excess), thereis only a normal rental excess for the period if—, (a)the normal rent, reduced by an amount equal to the reduction under thatsection, exceeds, (b)the accountancy rental earnings., (4)And in that case the amount of the normal rental excess for the period isequal to that excess., (5)In this Chapter “cumulative normal rental excess”,

lease exceed the normalrent, and, (b)the amount of the bad debt deduction exceeds the amount of the accountancyrental earnings,, the cumulative accountancy rental excess for that period is reduced by theamount of the excess of that deduction over those earnings (but not so as toreduce the amount of that rental excess below nil)., (3)Subsections (4) and (5) apply if for that period the accountancy rentalearnings in relation to the lease do not exceed the normal rent., (4)The amount of the cumulative accountancy rental excess that may be setagainst the taxable rent for that period under section
