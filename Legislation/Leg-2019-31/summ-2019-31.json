    "summary": "The Historical Institutional Abuse (Northern Ireland) Act 2019 is a law passed to help survivors of childhood abuse in institutions in Northern Ireland receive compensation. It established the Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Board and the Commissioner for Survivors of Institutional Childhood Abuse. To qualify for compensation, you must have been a child resident in an institution in Northern Ireland between 1922 and 1995 and meet certain age requirements. You can apply for compensation through the Board, and the panel will review your application and decide how much compensation you deserve. If you disagree with the decision, you can appeal to the Board. The law also protects your right to privacy and confidentiality during the application and appeal processes."
