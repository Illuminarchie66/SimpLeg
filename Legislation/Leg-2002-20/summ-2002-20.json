    "general": "This act allows industrial and provident societies (like cooperatives) to change their legal structure to be more like a company, making it easier for them to do business and compete with other companies. It also makes it easier for these societies to merge with other companies or transfer their assets and liabilities to a company. This helps these societies to grow and succeed while still maintaining their social purpose and member-owned status.",

This means that members must vote in favor of the change through a special resolution. The act also gives the government the power to make changes to the laws about companies and societies to make them more similar. However, this act only applies to England and Wales, not Northern Ireland.\nIn simpler terms, this law allows groups called \"societies\" to turn themselves into businesses called \"companies.\" They have to follow some rules and get approval from their members before doing so. The government can also make changes to the laws about companies and societies to make them more similar. But, this law only applies to England and Wales, not Northern Ireland.",
