    "general": "The State Pension Credit Act of 2002 created a new type of financial assistance for older people who are not eligible for a full state pension. This law established \"state pension credit\" as a way to help those individuals pay their basic living expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments, utility bills, and other essential costs. The act also made changes to an existing law from 1993 that affected how pension schemes were managed. In short, this law helps low-income seniors by providing them with additional financial support to cover their basic needs.",
