information under section339ZB(1) as a result of that request.\n\t\tThe making of a required notification in good faith is to be treated assatisfying any requirement to make the required disclosure on the part of A, Band C.\n\t\t\tThis is subject to section 339ZE(1) to (8).\n\t\tThe making of a joint disclosure report in good faith is to be treated assatisfying any requirement to make the required
