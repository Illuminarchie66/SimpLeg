This includes the ability to obtain \"unexplained wealth orders,\" which force individuals to reveal details about their assets and how they obtained them. If the assets are found to be linked to illegal activities, they can be seized and forfeited to the government. Additionally, the act allows for the forfeiture of money held in frozen bank accounts if it is believed to be connected to illegal activities. This legislation helps law enforcement agencies combat money laundering and other financial crimes more effectively."
