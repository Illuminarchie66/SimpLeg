    "summary": "The Charities Act 2022 simplifies and streamlines the law governing charities in the United Kingdom. It makes it easier for charities to amend their purposes, and introduces new powers for unincorporated charities to amend their trusts. Additionally, the act allows for the application of cy-pr\u00e8s to specific charitable purposes that fail, and improves transparency and accountability in relation to the disposal of land. Finally, the act gives the UK government the power to change the name of a charity if necessary, and confirms the appointment of trustees for charities, even if there are defects in the appointment process."
