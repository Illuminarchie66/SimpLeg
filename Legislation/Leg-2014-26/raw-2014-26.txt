##### “863ALimited liability partnerships: salaried members, 
(1)Subsection (2) applies at any time when conditions A to C in sections 863Bto 863D are met in the case of an individual (“M”) who is a member of alimited liability partnership in relation to which section 863(1) applies., 
(2)For the purposes of the Income Tax Acts—, 
(a)M is to be treated as being employed by the limited liability partnershipunder a contract of service instead of being a member of the partnership, and, 
(b)accordingly, M’s rights and duties as a member of the limited liabilitypartnership are to be treated as rights and duties under that contract ofservice., 
(3)This section needs to be read with section 863G (anti-avoidance)., 
##### 863BCondition A, 
(1)The question of whether condition A is met is to be determined at thefollowing times—, 
(a)if relevant arrangements are in place—, 
(i)at the beginning of the tax year 2014-15, or, 
(ii)if later, when M becomes a member of the limited liability partnership,, 
at the time mentioned in sub-paragraph (i) or (ii) (as the case may be);, 
(b)at any subsequent time when relevant arrangements are put in place ormodified;, 
(c)where—, 
(i)the question has previously been determined, and, 
(ii)the relevant arrangements which were in place at the time of the previousdetermination do not end, and are not modified, by the end of the period whichwas the relevant period for the purposes of the previous determination (seestep 1 in subsection (3)),, 
immediately after the end of that period., 
(2)“Relevant arrangements” means arrangements under which amounts are to be,or may be, payable by the limited liability partnership in respect of M’sperformance of services for the partnership in M’s capacity as a member of thepartnership., 
(3)Take the following steps to determine whether condition A is met at a time(“the relevant time”)., 
  * _Step 1_, 
Identify the relevant period by reference to the relevant arrangements whichare in place at the relevant time., 
“The relevant period” means the period—, 
(a), 
beginning with the relevant time, and, 
(b), 
ending at the time when, as at the relevant time, it is reasonable to expectthat the relevant arrangements will end or be modified., 
  * _Step 2_, 
Condition A is met if, at the relevant time, it is reasonable to expect thatat least 80% of the total amount payable by the limited liability partnershipin respect of M’s performance during the relevant period of services for thepartnership in M’s capacity as a member of the partnership will be disguisedsalary., 
An amount within the total amount is “disguised salary” if it—, 
(a), 
is fixed,, 
(b), 
is variable, but is varied without reference to the overall amount of theprofits or losses of the limited liability partnership, or, 
(c), 
is not, in practice, affected by the overall amount of those profits orlosses., 
(4)If condition A is determined to be met, or not to be met, at a time, thecondition is to be treated as met, or as not met, at all subsequent timesuntil the question is required to be re-determined under subsection (1)(b) or(c)., 
(5)In this section “arrangements” includes any agreement, understanding,scheme, transaction or series of transactions (whether or not legallyenforceable)., 
##### 863CCondition B,

(2)That amount is the total amount of the disguised salary which, at therelevant time, it is reasonable to expect will be payable by the limitedliability partnership in respect of M’s performance during the relevant taxyear of services for the partnership in M’s capacity as a member of thepartnership., 
In this section “the relevant tax year” means the tax year in which therelevant time falls and an amount is “disguised salary” if it falls within anyof paragraphs (a) to (c) at step 2 in section 863B(3)., 
(3)The question of whether condition C is met is to be determined—, 
(a)at the beginning of the tax year 2014-15 or, if later, the time at which Mbecomes a member of the limited liability partnership;, 
(b)after that, at the beginning of each tax year., 
(4)If in a tax year—, 
(a)there is a change in M’s contribution to the limited liability partnership,or, 
(b)there is otherwise a change of circumstances which might affect thequestion of whether condition C is met,, 
the question of whether the condition is met is to be re-determined at thetime of the change., 
This subsection is subject to section 863F(3)., 
(5)If condition C is determined to be met (including by virtue of subsection(7)), or not to be met, at the relevant time, the condition is to be treatedas met, or as not met, at all subsequent times until the question is requiredto be re-determined under subsection (3)(b) or (4)., 
(6)Subsection (7) applies if—, 
(a)the relevant time coincides with an increase in M’s contribution to thelimited liability partnership, and, 
(b)apart from subsection (7), that increase would cause condition C not to bemet at the relevant time., 
(7)Condition C is to be treated as met at the relevant time unless, at thattime, it is reasonable to expect that condition C will not be met for theremainder of the relevant tax year (ignoring this subsection)., 
(8)If there are any excluded days in the relevant tax year (see subsections(9) to (11)), in subsection (1) the reference to M’s contribution to thelimited liability partnership is to be read as a reference to thatcontribution multiplied by the following fraction—,

(a)which is after the day on which the relevant time falls, and, 
(b)on which it is reasonable to expect that M will not be a member of thelimited liability partnership,, 
is an “excluded” day for the purposes of subsection (8)., 
(11)If the relevant time coincides with an increase in M’s contribution to thelimited liability partnership, any day in the relevant tax year—, 
(a)which is before the day on which the relevant time falls, and, 
(b)on which condition C is met,, 
is an “excluded” day for the purposes of subsection (8)., 
(12)In subsections (6) and (11) references to an increase in M’s contributionto the limited liability partnership include (in particular)—, 
(a)the making of M’s first contribution to the capital of the limitedliability partnership, and,

(2)Amount A is the total amount which M has contributed to the limitedliability partnership as capital less so much of that amount (if any) as iswithin subsection (6)., 
(3)In particular, M’s share of any profits of the limited liabilitypartnership is to be included in the amount which M has contributed to thepartnership as capital so far as that share has been added to thepartnership’s capital., 
(4)In subsection (3) the reference to profits is to profits calculated inaccordance with generally accepted accounting practice (before any adjustmentrequired or authorised by law in calculating profits for income tax purposes)., 
(5)Subsection (3) applies as well for the purpose of construing references tocontributions to the capital of the limited liability partnership in sections863D(12)(a) and 863F., 
(6)An amount of capital is within this subsection if it is an amount which—, 
(a)M has previously drawn out or received back,,

(a)at the time mentioned in section 863D(3)(a), or, 
(b)at any subsequent time during the relevant period,, 
M is to be treated as having made the contribution at the time mentioned insection 863D(3)(a) (so far as M has not (actually) made the contribution atthe time at which it is being determined whether condition C is met)., 
(3)If M (actually) makes the contribution (in whole or in part) during therelevant period, the question of whether condition C is met is not to be re-determined under section 863D(4) just because of the making of thecontribution (in whole or in part).,
