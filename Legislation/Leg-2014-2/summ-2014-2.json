    "general": "This law makes changes to how local councils and other public bodies are audited and held accountable for their spending. It gets rid of an old organization called the Audit Commission and replaces it with new rules and procedures for auditing. The law also says who can be appointed as local auditors and what they should do. Additionally, it talks about sharing information between different organizations and making sure that meetings and documents of local government bodies are open to the public. Finally, it deals with issues related to council tax increases and votes held in parishes.",

    "summary": "The Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 changes the way local authorities and NHS bodies in England are audited. It gets rid of the Audit Commission and sets up a new system for auditing these organisations. This means that local authorities and NHS bodies will no longer be audited by the same body, and instead, they will be audited by a different organisation.\nUnder the new system, local authorities and NHS bodies will still have to publish information about their finances and governance, but they won't have to do it in the same way as before. They may be able to use simpler forms and less detailed information, depending on their size and the type of information they need to publish.\nSmaller authorities, with a gross income or expenditure of less than \u00a36.5 million in a financial year, will have fewer reporting requirements than larger ones. However, they will still have to publish some basic information about their finances and governance.\nAdditionally, the act gives more powers to local residents who want to scrutinize the actions of their local councils. Residents can ask for information about the council's finances and governance, and they can even ask for an investigation if they suspect something is wrong.\nFinally, the act makes changes to the rules around council tax referendums in the UK. These changes allow for the possibility of polls being held during parish meetings, subject to regulations made by the Secretary of State."
