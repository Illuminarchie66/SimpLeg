    "summary": "The Welfare Reform Act 2007 changed the way benefits are given to people in need. It created new rules for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) and Income Support, like medical tests and limits on money. It also started a program to help people get back to work. People with severe disabilities are now in a special group that protects them from having to work. Private companies or people can now do some of the work related to welfare changes. The government can change how benefits are calculated and how they are given. Local governments have to follow rules set by the government when giving benefits. If someone gets too much money, the government can take it back. The government can also punish people who don't follow the rules. Some people who were not eligible for benefits before can now get them. The law also changed how vaccines are given in certain situations."
