    "general": "This law makes sure that when important events or issues happen, there will be an official investigation called an inquiry to figure out what happened and why. The purpose of an inquiry is to gather information and provide answers so that we can learn from these events and improve things for the future. This law sets out rules for how inquiries should be carried out and what they should cover. It's like having a special court case where experts and witnesses come together to find out the truth about something important.",
