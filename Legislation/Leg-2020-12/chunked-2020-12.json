is proposed that more than one person should act as the monitor inrelation to the proposed moratorium\u2014\n\t\t\teach of them must make a statement under subsection (1)(b), (c) and (e),and\n\t\t\tthe statement under subsection (1)(b) must specify\u2014\n\t\t\twhich functions (if any) are to be exercised by the persons acting jointly,and\n\t\t\twhich functions (if any) are to be
