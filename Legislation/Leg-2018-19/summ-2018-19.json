    "summary": "The Haulage Permits and Trailer Registration Act of 2018 regulates how goods are transported internationally by road. The UK government may restrict the use of British goods vehicles on foreign trips to safeguard the environment and public health. To drive abroad, British goods vehicles need international road transport licenses, and the government limits the quantity of permits issued to avoid overcrowding and air pollution. Temporary exceptions for international operators in emergency situations are allowed under the law. All trailers must now be registered and show a distinct ID number under suggested modifications to the law. This aims to enhance traffic safety and cut down on congestion brought on by poorly kept or overloaded trailers. Before making any rules, the government must speak with particular persons.\nPlease note that I've used simpler words and phrases, shorter sentences, and removed technical jargon to make the text easier to comprehend. Additionally, I've added more explanatory sentences to help the reader understand the main points of the legislation."
