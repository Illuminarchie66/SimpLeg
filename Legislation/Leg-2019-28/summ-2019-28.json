    "general": "This law changes two old laws called the Census Act 1920 and the Census Act (Northern Ireland) 1969. It adds new questions to the census form that ask people about their sexual orientation and gender identity. This will help the government get a better idea of how many people identify as LGBTQ+ in the UK, which can help them make policies that are more inclusive for everyone. The law also removes penalties for not answering these questions truthfully, so people feel more comfortable sharing their identities.",

    "summary": "The new law makes it easier for people to tell the truth about who they are when filling out the census form. Before, some people might have been afraid to say if they were LGBTQ+ because it was against the law to ask about those things. Now, it is legal to ask about sexual orientation and gender identity so everyone can be honest and accurate when answering the questions. This means we will get more correct data about our communities and make sure everyone is treated equally under the law. It also means that no one will face penalties or fines for not providing information about their sexual orientation or gender identity. This law only applies to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It went into effect right away after being passed. So, when you fill out your next census form, you'll see questions about sexual orientation and gender identity, and you can feel safe telling the truth about yourself!",
