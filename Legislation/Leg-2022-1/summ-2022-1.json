    "general": "This law makes changes to how much money people have to pay when they rent a house or flat from someone else for a long time, called a \"long lease\". Before this law was made, some landlords were charging too much rent and making it hard for tenants to afford their homes. This law helps tenants by limiting how much rent they have to pay and making sure that landlords can't charge too much. It also helps landlords by giving them more control over their properties and making it easier for them to sell or transfer their leases.",
