    "summary": "The Appropriation Act 2010 gives permission to spend \u00a342 billion on things like public services and debt interest for the financial year that ended on March 31, 2010. This includes \u00a311.5 billion specifically for the year ending March 31, 2010. The law also moves money around between different funds to make sure there's enough cash available for everything. It changes some rules about how much can be spent on different things, so that up to \u00a31,774 million can be used for both \"operating\" and \"non-operating\" expenses. Finally, the law lets the government keep some money in the Consolidated Fund without having to pay it back right away, as long as certain conditions are met.\nIn simpler terms, the Appropriation Act 2010 allows the government to spend a lot of money (\u00a342 billion) on important things like schools, hospitals, and debt interest for the financial year that ended on March 31, 2010. It also shuffles money around between different funds to make sure there's enough cash available for everything. Additionally, the law changes some spending limits so that more money can be used for specific purposes. Lastly, the law gives the government flexibility in managing its finances by letting them keep some money in the Consolidated Fund without having to pay it back right away.",
