It sets out the rules and requirements for these societies, including eligibility criteria, registration processes, and the process for cancelling registration. The act also specifies the types of societies that can be registered, such as co-operative societies and community benefit societies, and outlines the requirements for a society's name, rules, and investments. Additionally, the act allows registered societies to hold and purchase land, invest in various securities, and convert into companies. The act also includes provisions related to the dissolution of societies, winding up, and offenses related to the management and operations of co-operative and community benefit societies. Finally, the act gives the UK government the power to modify the laws related to cooperative and community benefit societies, so that they align with the laws related to companies."
