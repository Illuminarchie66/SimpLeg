is\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta society registered under this Act on or after 1 August 2014 (the day thisAct comes into force), or\n\t\t\t\t(by virtue of section 150(1)) a society that immediately before that datewas registered or treated as registered under the 1965 Act.\n\t\t\tIn this Act \u201cthe 1965 Act\u201d means the Industrial and Provident Societies Act1965.\n\tRegistration\n\t\tSocieties that may be registered\n\t\t\tA society for carrying on any industry, business or trade (includingdealings of any kind with land) which meets the conditions in subsection (2)may be registered under this Act as\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta co-operative society, or\n\t\t\t\ta community benefit society.\n\t\t\tThe conditions are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat it is shown to the satisfaction of the FCA\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin the case of registration as a co-operative society, that the society isa bona fide co-operative society, or\n\t\t\t\tin the case of registration as a community benefit society, that thebusiness of the society is being, or is intended to be, conducted for thebenefit of the community,\n\t\t\t\tthat\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tthe society has at least 3 members, or\n\t\t\t\tthe society has 2 members both of which are registered societies,\n\t\t\t\tthat the society\u2019s rules contain provision in respect of the mattersmentioned in section 14, and\n\t\t\t\tthat the place that under those rules is to be the society\u2019s registeredoffice is in Great Britain or the Channel Islands.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (2)(a)(i) \u201cco-operative society\u201d does notinclude a society that carries on, or intends to carry on, business with theobject of making profits mainly for the payment of interest, dividends orbonuses on money invested or deposited with, or lent to, the society or anyother person.\n\t\t\tFor registration under this Act as a credit union, see the Credit UnionsAct 1979.\n\t\tRegistration \n\t\t\tAn application for the registration of a society under this Act is made bysending the following to the FCA\u2014\n\t\t\t\tan application for registration, signed by\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe society\u2019s secretary and 3 of its members, or\n\t\t\t\twhere both or all of its members are registered societies, the secretariesof 2 of those registered societies, and\n\t\t\t\t2 copies of the society\u2019s rules or, if the application is made byelectronic means, 1 copy of those rules.\n\t\t\tIf the FCA is satisfied that the society has complied with the requirementsunder this Act as to registration, it must\u2014\n\t\t\t\tregister the society, and\n\t\t\t\tgive the society an acknowledgment of registration bearing the FCA's seal.\n\t\t\tA registered society is by virtue of its registration a body corporate byits registered name, with limited liability.\n\t\t\tThe society may sue and be sued by its registered name.\n\t\t\tRegistration vests in the society all property for the time being vested inany person in trust for the society.\n\t\t\tAny legal proceedings pending by or against the trustees of the society may(once the society is registered) be brought or continued by or against thesociety.\n\t\t\tThe acknowledgement of registration also constitutes an acknowledgment of,and is conclusive evidence of, the registration under this Act of the rules ofthe society in force at the date of the society\u2019s registration.\n\t\tRegistration etc: special cases\n\t\t\tA society which has any withdrawable share capital may not be registeredwith the object of carrying on the business of banking.\n\t\t\tSection 67(2) (taking of deposits below limits specified there not to betreated as carrying on the business of banking) applies for the purposes ofsubsection (1).\n\t\t\tFor the prohibition on registering a society whose objects are wholly orsubstantially those of a credit union otherwise than as a credit union, seesection 2(3) of the Credit Unions Act 1979.\n\t\t\tSubsection (5) applies where, for the purposes of securing (andmaintaining) approval of its profit sharing scheme in accordance with Part 1of Schedule 9 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, the rules of asociety that is a workers\u2019 co-operative contain any of the following\u2014\n\t\t\t\tprovision for membership of the society by trustees of the scheme;\n\t\t\t\tprovision denying voting rights to those trustees;\n\t\t\t\tother provisions which appear to the FCA to be reasonably necessary forthat purpose.\n\t\t\tThe provisions are to be disregarded in determining\u2014\n\t\t\t\twhether the society should be registered as a co-operative society underthis Act;\n\t\t\t\tif the society is a registered society, whether for the purposes of thisPart the society is a bona fide co-operative society.\n\tCancellation of registration\n\t\tCancellation of registration: conditions for cancellation\n\t\t\tThe FCA may, in writing, cancel the registration of a registered society ifany of conditions A to E is met.\n\t\t\tCondition A is that\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe society has requested the cancellation of its registration,\n\t\t\t\tthe request is evidenced in such way as the FCA from time to time directs,and\n\t\t\t\tthe FCA considers it appropriate to cancel the registration.\n\t\t\tCondition B is that any of the following is proved to the FCA\u2019ssatisfaction\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat an acknowledgment of registration has been obtained by fraud ormistake;\n\t\t\t\tthat the society has less than 3 members (and does not have 2 members bothof which are registered societies);\n\t\t\t\tthat the society has ceased to exist.\n\t\t\tCondition C is that it is proved to the FCA\u2019s satisfaction\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat the society exists for an illegal purpose, or\n\t\t\t\tthat the society has wilfully and after notice from the FCA violated any ofthe provisions of this Act.\n\t\t\tCondition D is that it appears to the FCA\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a society registered as a co-operative society, that thecondition in section 2(2)(a)(i) is not met;\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a society registered as a community benefit society, thatthe condition in section 2(2)(a)(ii) is not met;\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a pre-commencement society, that neither of the conditionsin section 2(2)(a) is met.\n\t\t\tCondition E is that\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe society\u2019s registered rules contain provision of a kind authorised bysection 22 (rules of agricultural, horticultural or forestry society), and\n\t\t\t\tit appears to the FCA that\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe society no longer consists mainly of members of a kind mentioned inthat section, or\n\t\t\t\tthe activities carried on by the society do not mainly consist in makingadvances to its members for the purposes mentioned there.\n\t\tCancellation of registration: procedure and effect\n\t\t\tThe FCA must give a registered society at least 2 months\u2019 notice in writingof the proposed cancellation of its registration, specifying briefly theground of the proposed cancellation.\n\t\t\tSubsection (1) does not apply to any cancellation\u2014\n\t\t\t\tmade by virtue of condition A in section 5 (cancellation at society\u2019srequest),\n\t\t\t\tmade by virtue of section 112(2) (cancellation following conversion into acompany etc), or\n\t\t\t\tmade after a relevant certificate within the meaning of section 126(certificate that society\u2019s property has been transferred to persons entitledto it) has been lodged with the FCA.\n\t\t\tIf the society appeals under section 9 before the end of the period ofnotice, its registration may not be cancelled before the date the appeal isdetermined or abandoned.\n\t\t\t\tFor the FCA\u2019s power to suspend the society\u2019s registration in thesecircumstances, see section 8(3).\n\t\t\tFor the right of the society to make representations and to be heard by theFCA in a case where condition D in section 5 is relied on, see section 7.\n\t\t\tThe FCA must consult the PRA before cancelling the registration of aregistered society that is a PRA-authorised person.\n\t\t\tThe FCA must ensure that, as soon as

in which thesociety\u2019s registered office is situated.\n\t\t\tAs from the date of publication of the notice in the Gazette, the societyceases to be entitled to any of the privileges of this Act as a registeredsociety.\n\t\t\tThis does not affect any liability incurred by the society (which may beenforced against it as if the cancellation had not occurred).\n\t\tCancellation of registration: additional procedure in cases involvingcondition D\n\t\t\tThis section applies where the FCA gives a registered society a noticeunder section 6 (notice of proposed cancellation of registration) specifying aground set out in condition D in section 5.\n\t\t\tThe FCA must consider any representations about the proposed cancellationthat the society makes to it in the period of notice.\n\t\t\tIf the society requests, the FCA must give the society an opportunity ofbeing heard by the FCA before its registration is cancelled.\n\t\t\tIf, at any time after the end of one month from the date the notice isgiven, it appears to the FCA that there have not been taken the steps which bythat time could reasonably have been taken for the purpose of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tconverting the society into a company, amalgamating it with a company, ortransferring its engagements to a company, in accordance with section 112, or\n\t\t\t\tdissolving the society under section 119 or 123,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe FCA may give such directions as it considers appropriate for securing thatthe society\u2019s affairs are wound up before its registration is cancelled.\n\t\t\tThe FCA must consult the PRA before giving directions under subsection (4)to a registered society that is a PRA-authorised person.\n\t\t\tA person who contravenes or fails to comply with a direction undersubsection (4) commits an offence.\n\t\t\tA person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summaryconviction\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin England and Wales, to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standardscale;\n\t\t\t\tin Scotland, to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale orimprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months (or both).\n\tSuspension of registration\n\t\tSuspension of registration\n\t\t\tIf any of conditions C to E in section 5 is met in relation to a society,the FCA may by notice in writing\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsuspend the society\u2019s registration for a term not exceeding 3 months, and\n\t\t\t\tfrom time to time renew any suspension for a term not exceeding 3 months.\n\t\t\tThe FCA must give a registered society at least 2 months\u2019 notice in writingof the proposed suspension of its registration under subsection (1)(a),specifying briefly the ground of the proposed suspension.\n\t\t\tWhere\u2014 \n\t\t\t\ta notice of proposed cancellation of a society\u2019s registration is givenunder section 6, and\n\t\t\t\tbefore the end of the period of notice, the society appeals under section 9against the proposed cancellation,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe FCA may by notice in writing suspend the society\u2019s registration from theend of that period until the date the appeal is determined or abandoned.\n\t\t\tThe FCA must consult the PRA before suspending, or renewing the suspensionof, the registration of a registered society that is a PRA-authorised person.\n\t\t\tThe FCA must ensure that, as soon as practicable after the suspension orrenewal of suspension of a society\u2019s registration, notice of the suspension orrenewal is published in\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe Gazette, and\n\t\t\t\ta local newspaper circulating in or about the locality in which thesociety\u2019s registered office is situated.\n\t\t\tFrom the date of publication of the notice in the Gazette until the end ofthe period for which the society\u2019s registration is suspended, the society isnot entitled to any of the privileges of this Act as a registered society.\n\t\t\tThis does not affect any liability incurred by the society (which may beenforced against it as if the suspension had not occurred).\n\tAppeals\n\t\tAppeal against refusal to register or cancellation or suspension ofregistration\n\t\t\tA society may appeal to the appropriate court from a decision of the FCA\u2014\n\t\t\t\tto refuse to register the society (but see subsection (3)),\n\t\t\t\tto cancel the society\u2019s registration (but see subsections (3) to (5)), or\n\t\t\t\tto renew a suspension of the society\u2019s registration so far as the renewalprovides for the suspension to continue more than 3 months from the date itsregistration was first suspended.\n\t\t\t\u201cThe appropriate court\u201d means\u2014\n\t\t\t\tif the society\u2019s registered office is in Scotland, the Court of Session;\n\t\t\t\totherwise, the High Court.\n\t\t\tNo appeal may be made against\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta refusal to register a society on the ground that a condition in section2(2)(a) is not met, or\n\t\t\t\ta decision to cancel a society\u2019s registration on the ground that conditionD in section 5 is met.\n\t\t\tNo appeal may be made against a cancellation within section 6(2).\n\t\t\tAn appeal against a decision to cancel a society\u2019s registration must belodged before the end of the period of notice of the proposed cancellationgiven under section 6.\n\t\t\tIf a decision to refuse to register a society is overruled on appeal, theFCA must register the society and give it an acknowledgment of registrationunder section 3."

who alleges\u2014\n\t\t\tthat a person knew that an act was not permitted by the society\u2019sregistered rules or was beyond the powers of the committee, or\n\t\t\tthat a person knew that the society was a charity,\n\t\t\thas the burden of proving the allegation.\n\tTransactions with committee members etc in excess of powers\n\t\tThis section applies where\u2014\n\t\t\ta registered society enters into a transaction the parties to whichinclude\u2014\n\t\t\ta member of the society\u2019s committee, or\n\t\t\ta person connected with such a member, and\n\t\t\tin connection with the transaction, the society\u2019s committee exceeds anylimitation on its powers under the society\u2019s registered rules.\n\t\tThe transaction is voidable at the instance of the society.\n\t\tWhether or not it is avoided, a party to the transaction who is withinsubsection (1)(a)(i) or (ii), and any member of the committee who authorisedthe transaction, is liable\u2014\n\t\t\tto account to the society for any gain made directly or indirectly by thetransaction, and\n\t\t\tto indemnify the society for any loss or damage resulting from thetransaction.\n\t\tNothing in the above provisions excludes the operation of any otherenactment or rule of law by virtue of which the transaction may be called inquestion or any liability to the society may arise.\n\t\tThe transaction ceases to be voidable if\u2014\n\t\t\trestitution of any money or other asset which was the subject matter of thetransaction is no longer possible,\n\t\t\tthe society is indemnified for any loss or damage resulting from thetransaction,\n\t\t\trights acquired bona fide for value and without actual notice of thecommittee\u2019s exceeding its powers by a person who is not party to thetransaction would be affected by the avoidance, or\n\t\t\tthe transaction is ratified by the society in general meeting in such a wayas the case may require.\n\t\tA person other than a member of the committee is not liable undersubsection (3) if the person shows that at the time the transaction wasentered into the person did not know that the committee was exceeding itspowers.\n\t\tThis section does not affect the operation of section 45 (power ofcommittee to bind the society) in relation to any party to the transaction notwithin subsection (1)(a)(i) or (ii) above.\n\t\tBut if the transaction is voidable by virtue of this section and valid byvirtue of that section in favour of such a person, the appropriate court may,on the application of that person or the society, make such order affirming,severing or setting aside the transaction, on such terms, as appear to thecourt to be just.\n\t\tIn the case of a charitable registered society whose registered office isin England or Wales, any ratification of the transaction is ineffectivewithout the prior written consent of the Charity Commission for England andWales.\n\tSection 48: definitions\n\t\tThis section supplements section 48.\n\t\t\u201cThe appropriate court\u201d, in relation to a registered society, means thecourt having jurisdiction to wind up the society under the provisions of theInsolvency Act 1986 as applied by section 123.\n\t\t\u201cTransaction\u201d includes any act.\n\t\tThe reference in section 48(1) to limitations under the society\u2019sregistered rules includes limitations deriving\u2014\n\t\t\tfrom a resolution of the society in general meeting or a meeting of anyclass of members, or\n\t\t\tfrom any agreement between the members of the society or of any class ofmembers.\n\t\tSections 252 to 255 of

to any member who makes a request forthem before that date, and\n\t\t\tsend a copy of any such representations to any member who makes such arequest.\n\t\t\t\tSee section 96 for provisions about providing a copy of the representations byplacing them on a website.\n\t\tThe auditor may require any representations made by the auditor before thedate of the general meeting to be read out at the meeting.\n\t\tThis does not affect the auditor\u2019s right to be heard orally.\n\t\tBut if, on the application of the society or any other person, theappropriate court is satisfied that the rights conferred by this section arebeing abused to secure needless publicity for defamatory matter\u2014\n\t\t\tcopies of the representations need not be sent out, and\n\t\t\tthe representations need not be read out at the meeting.\n\t\tThe appropriate court may order the auditor to pay all or part of thesociety\u2019s costs (or, in Scotland, expenses) on an application under thissection, even if the

website\n\t\tThis section applies where a society is required by section 95(3)(b) tosend a person a copy of the representations referred to there.\n\t\tThe society is regarded as sending the person a copy of a documentcontaining the representations if the following conditions are met\u2014\n\t\t\tthe person has agreed (generally or specifically) that the society may makethe document available to the person on a website (and has not revoked thatagreement);\n\t\t\tthe society has notified the person of the following\u2014\n\t\t\tthe website address;\n\t\t\tthe presence of the document on the
