    "general": "The Insolvency Act 2000 is a law that helps people who are unable to pay their debts (called \"insolvent\"). It provides ways for them to deal with their debts, such as by making a plan to repay some or all of their debts over time. The law also allows for the disqualification of company directors who have not acted properly. This means that they may be banned from being a director of a company again. The purpose of the law is to help individuals and businesses get back on track financially and to protect creditors from unfair practices.",
