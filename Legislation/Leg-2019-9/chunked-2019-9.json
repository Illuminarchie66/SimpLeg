respect of a person (the \u201cdefendant\u201d) if itappears to the chief officer that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe defendant has carried out acts associated with stalking,\n\t\t\tthe defendant poses a risk associated with stalking to another person, and\n\t\t\tthere is reasonable cause to believe the proposed order is necessary toprotect another person from such a risk (whether or not the other person wasthe victim of the acts mentioned in paragraph (a)).\n\t\tA stalking protection order is an order which, for the purpose ofpreventing the defendant from carrying out acts associated with stalking\u2014\n\t\t\tprohibits the defendant from doing anything described in the order, or\n\t\t\trequires the defendant to do anything described in the order.\n\t\tA chief officer of police for a police area in England and Wales may applyfor a stalking protection order only in respect of a person\u2014\n\t\t\twho resides in the chief officer\u2019s police area, or\n\t\t\twho the chief officer believes is in that area or is intending to come toit.\n\t\tA risk associated with stalking\u2014\n\t\t\tmay be in respect of physical or psychological harm to the other person;\n\t\t\tmay arise from acts which the defendant knows or ought to know areunwelcome to the other person even if, in other circumstances, the acts wouldappear harmless in themselves.\n\t\tIt does not matter\u2014\n\t\t\twhether the acts mentioned in subsection (1)(a) were carried out in a partof the United Kingdom or elsewhere, or\n\t\t\twhether they were carried out before or after the commencement of thissection.\n\t\tSee section 2A of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 for examples ofacts associated with stalking.\n\tPower to make orders\n\t\tA magistrates\u2019 court may make a stalking protection order on an applicationunder section 1(1) if satisfied that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe defendant has carried out acts associated with stalking,\n\t\t\tthe defendant poses a risk associated with stalking to another person, and\n\t\t\tthe proposed order is necessary to protect another person from such a risk(whether or not the other person was the victim of the acts mentioned inparagraph (a)).\n\t\tA magistrates\u2019 court may include a prohibition or requirement in a stalkingprotection order only if satisfied that the prohibition or requirement isnecessary to protect the other person from a risk associated with stalking.\n\t\tProhibitions or requirements must, so far as practicable, be such as toavoid\u2014\n\t\t\tconflict with the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs, and\n\t\t\tinterference with any times at which the defendant normally works orattends an educational establishment.\n\t\tA prohibition or requirement has effect in all parts of the United Kingdomunless expressly limited to a particular locality.\n\t\tIt does not matter\u2014\n\t\t\twhether the acts mentioned in subsection (1)(a) were carried out in a partof the United Kingdom or elsewhere, or\n\t\t\twhether they were carried out before or after the commencement of thissection.\n\t\tSubsection (7) applies where a magistrates\u2019 court makes a stalkingprotection order in relation to a defendant who is already subject to such anorder (whether made by that court or another).\n\t\tThe court may not include any prohibition or requirement in the newstalking protection order which is incompatible with a prohibition orrequirement in the earlier stalking protection order.\n\tDuration of orders\n\t\tA stalking protection order has effect\u2014\n\t\t\tfor a fixed period specified in the order, or\n\t\t\tuntil a further order.\n\t\tWhere a fixed period is specified it must be a period of at least 2 yearsbeginning with the day on which the order is made.\n\t\tDifferent periods may be specified in relation to different prohibitions orrequirements.\n\tVariations, renewals and discharges\n\t\tThe defendant or a relevant chief officer of police (see section 14(1)) mayapply to a magistrates\u2019 court for an order varying, renewing or discharging astalking protection order.\n\t\tBefore making a decision on an application under subsection (1), the courtmust hear\u2014\n\t\t\tthe defendant, and\n\t\t\tany relevant chief officer of police who wants to be heard.\n\t\tOn an application under subsection (1) the court may make any ordervarying, renewing or discharging the stalking protection order that the courtconsiders appropriate.\n\t\tBut the court may not\u2014\n\t\t\tin renewing or varying an order, impose an additional prohibition orrequirement unless satisfied that it is necessary to do so in order to protecta person from a risk associated with stalking;\n\t\t\tdischarge an order before the end of 2 years beginning with the day onwhich the order was made without the consent of the defendant and\u2014\n\t\t\twhere the application was made by a chief officer of police, that chiefofficer, or\n\t\t\tin any other case, the chief officer of police who applied for thestalking protection order and (if different) the chief officer of police forthe area in which the defendant resides, if that area is in England or Wales.\n\tInterim stalking protection orders\n\t\tThis section applies where an application for a stalking protection order(the \u201cmain application\u201d) has not been determined.\n\t\tA magistrates\u2019 court may make an order (an \u201cinterim stalking protectionorder\u201d) in respect of the defendant on an application\u2014\n\t\t\tmade at the same time and by the same chief officer of police as the mainapplication, or\n\t\t\tif the main application has already been made, made by the chief officer ofpolice who made that application.\n\t\tThe court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, make an interimstalking protection order\u2014\n\t\t\tprohibiting the defendant from doing anything described in the order, or\n\t\t\trequiring the defendant to do anything described in the order.\n\t\tProhibitions or requirements must, so far as practicable, be such as toavoid\u2014\n\t\t\tconflict with the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs, and\n\t\t\tinterference with any times at which the defendant normally works orattends an educational establishment.\n\t\tA prohibition or requirement has effect in all parts of the United Kingdomunless expressly limited to a particular locality.\n\t\tAn interim stalking protection order\u2014\n\t\t\thas effect only for a fixed period specified in the order, and\n\t\t\tceases to have effect, if it has not already done so, on the determinationof the main application.\n\t\tThe defendant or the chief officer of police who applied for an interimstalking protection order may apply to a magistrates\u2019 court for an ordervarying, renewing or discharging the interim stalking protection order.\n\t\tOn an application under subsection (7), the court may make any ordervarying, renewing or discharging the stalking protection order that the courtconsiders appropriate.\n\tContent of orders\n\t\tA stalking protection order and an interim stalking protection order mustspecify\u2014\n\t\t\tthe date on which the order is made;\n\t\t\twhether it has effect for a fixed period and, if it does, the length ofthat period;\n\t\t\teach prohibition or requirement that applies to the defendant;\n\t\t\twhether any prohibition or requirement is expressly limited to a particularlocality and, if it is, what the locality is;\n\t\t\twhether any prohibition or requirement is subject to a fixed period whichdiffers from the period for which the order has effect and, if it is, whatthat period is."
