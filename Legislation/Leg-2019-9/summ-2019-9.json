    "summary": "The Stalking Protection Act 2019 helps safeguard individuals from harassment and fear caused by stalking behavior. This law allows for the creation of stalking protection orders to protect people from stalkers. To get one of these orders, a chief officer of police must go to court and show that the stalker poses a risk to the victim. If the court agrees, the stalker will be ordered to stop their stalking behavior and may even be sent to jail or fined if they don't follow the rules. Victims must tell the police about their personal info within three days of getting the order. Failure to do so could lead to more charges and penalties. Overall, this law aims to keep victims safe from stalkers and the emotional distress they cause."
