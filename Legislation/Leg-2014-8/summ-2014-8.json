Even if they weren't living in the UK when they started their application, they can still apply for citizenship. The government can also ignore some rules if they think it's fair because of the person's military service. This law covers all parts of the UK and its territories.\nIn other words, this law makes it easier for members of the armed forces to become British citizens, regardless of where they were stationed or lived during their service. It gives the government the power to consider special circumstances related to military service when reviewing citizenship applications.",
