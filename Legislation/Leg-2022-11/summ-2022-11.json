The law also gets rid of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act from 2011 which made sure that all general elections had to happen every 5 years. This means that the Prime Minister now has more power over when elections happen.",

    "summary": "The Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022 changes how Parliament works. It gets rid of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which said that Parliament must meet for a fixed amount of time before being dissolved and replaced with a new one. Now, the power to end Parliament's term early returns to the hands of the person who can do so (usually the Prime Minister). This means that the Prime Minister can decide when to end Parliament's term and call a new election.\nBefore, courts could check if the Prime Minister was using their powers correctly. But now, they can't do that anymore. So, the Prime Minister has more freedom to choose when to end Parliament's term and call a new election.\nAdditionally, Parliament will automatically dissolve after five years, unless it is ended earlier by the Prime Minister. And some small changes were made to other laws to fix any issues that might come up because of these changes.",
