    "general": "This law makes rules for people who work together to improve their working conditions (trade unions). It also sets out how they can take action if they are not happy with their pay or other things at work. The law says that before taking any action, trade unions must get permission from their members first. This way, everyone knows what is happening and why. Additionally, the law gives more power to an official called the \"Certification Officer\" to ensure that all trade unions follow these rules.",

    "summary": "The Trade Union Act of 2016 has several key provisions that impact the way unions operate in the UK. Firstly, the law requires at least 50% of eligible voters to participate in a trade union ballot before they can take industrial action. Additionally, if more than half of the voters approve the strike, the union must meet an additional threshold of at least 40% of voters answering \"yes\" to a question about the importance of the service they provide. This is designed to prevent disruptive strikes in essential public services such as healthcare, education, fire services, transportation, and border security.\nFurthermore, the law requires unions to provide detailed information about the matter or matters in issue in the trade dispute, the type or types of industrial action being taken, and the expected duration of the action, on the voting paper. Unions must also report the results of the ballot to their members and to the Certification Officer, including the number of voters, the number of \"Yes\" and \"No\" votes, and other details.\nAdditionally, the law requires picketing to be supervised by a designated union representative to ensure peaceful and lawful activity. The union must provide the picket supervisor with a letter of approval, and the picket supervisor must carry identification and be easily reachable by the police and the employer.\nFinally, the law includes provisions related to the Certification Officer's powers and duties, specifically regarding investigative powers, enforcement of new annual return requirements, and the ability to impose financial penalties. The Certification Officer is exempt from ministerial direction, ensuring independence in decision-making and enforcement."
