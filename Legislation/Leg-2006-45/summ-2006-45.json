    "general": "The Animal Welfare Act 2006 is a law that helps protect animals from being treated cruelly or unfairly. It makes sure that people who have animals, like pet owners or farmers, must provide them with good care and living conditions. This includes giving them enough food, water, shelter, and medical attention when they need it. The law also says that animals should not be subjected to unnecessary pain, suffering, or distress. Additionally, it sets up rules for how animals should be transported and sold, so they are treated humanely throughout their lives. Overall, the purpose of this act is to ensure that all animals are treated with kindness and respect.",
