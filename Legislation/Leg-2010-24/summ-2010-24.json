    "general": "The Digital Economy Act 2010 is a law that helps protect people's work, like movies, music, and books, from being shared without permission on the internet. It also makes sure that TV and radio stations are run properly and that the airwaves are used fairly. The law sets up rules for companies that register internet domains (like.com or.uk) and gives more power to the Office of Communications (Ofcom) to enforce these rules. Additionally, it updates some old laws to make them relevant to new technology. Overall, the goal of the law is to keep the digital economy safe and fair for everyone.",
