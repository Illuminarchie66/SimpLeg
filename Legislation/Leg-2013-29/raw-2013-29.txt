out the rules for determining for thepurposes of relevant tax whether individuals are resident or not resident inthe UK., (2)The rules are referred to collectively as “the statutory residence test”., (3)The rules do not apply in determining for the purposes of relevant taxwhether individuals are resident or not resident in England, Wales, Scotlandor Northern Ireland specifically (rather than in the UK as a whole)., (4)“Relevant tax” means—, (a)income tax,, (b)capital gains tax, and, (c)(so far as the residence status of individuals is relevant to them)inheritance tax and corporation tax., (5)Key concepts used in the rules are defined in Part 2 of this Schedule., #### Interpretation of enactments, 2(1)In enactments relating to relevant tax, a reference to being resident (ornot resident) in the UK is, in the case of individuals, a reference to beingresident (or not resident) in the UK in accordance with the statutoryresidence test., (2)Sub-paragraph (1) applies even if the reference relates to the taxliability of an actual or deemed person that is not an individual (forexample, where the liability of another person depends on the residence statusof an individual)., (3)An individual who, in accordance with the statutory residence test, isresident (or not resident) in the UK “for” a tax year is taken for thepurposes of any enactment relating to relevant tax to be resident (or notresident) there at all times in that tax year., (4)But see Part 3 of this Schedule (split year treatment) for cases where theeffect of sub-paragraph (3) is relaxed in certain circumstances., (5)This Schedule has effect subject to any express provision to the contraryin (or falling to be recognised and acknowledged in law by virtue of) anyenactment., #### The basic rule, 3An individual (“P”) is resident in the UK for a tax year (“year X”) if—, (a)the automatic residence test is met for that year, or, (b)the sufficient ties test is met for that year., 4If neither of those tests is met for that year, P is not resident in the UKfor that year., #### The automatic residence test, 5The automatic residence test is met for year X if P meets—, (a)at least one of the automatic UK tests, and, (b)none of the automatic overseas tests., #### The automatic UK tests, 6There are 4 automatic UK tests., 7The first automatic UK test is that P spends at least 183 days in the UK inyear X., 8(1)The second automatic UK test is that—, (a)P has a home in the UK during all or part of year X,, (b)that home is one where P spends a sufficient amount of time in year X, and, (c)there is at least one period of 91 (consecutive) days in respect of whichthe following conditions are met—, (i)the 91-day period in question occurs while P has that home,, (ii)at least 30 days of that 91-day period fall within year X, and, (iii)throughout that 91-day period, condition A or condition B is met or acombination of those conditions is met., (2)Condition A is that P has no home overseas., (3)Condition B is that—, (a)P has one or more homes overseas, but, (b)each of those homes is a home where P spends no more than a permittedamount of time in year X., (4)In relation to a home of P’s in the UK, P “spends a sufficient amount oftime” there in year X if there are at least 30 days in year X when P ispresent there on that day for at least some of the time (no matter how short atime)., (5)In relation to a home of P’s overseas, P “spends no more than a permittedamount of time” there in year X if there are fewer than 30 days in year X whenP is present there on that day for at least some of the time (no matter howshort a time)., (6)In sub-paragraphs (4) and (5)—, (a)a reference to 30 days is to 30 days in aggregate, whether the days areconsecutive or intermittent, and, (b)a reference to P being present at the home is to P being present there at atime when it is a home of P’s (so presence there on any other occasion, forexample to look round the property with a view to buying it, is to bedisregarded)., (7)Sub-paragraph (1)(c) is satisfied so long as there is a period of 91 daysin respect of which the conditions described there are met, even if thoseconditions are in fact met for longer than that., (8)If P has more than one home in the UK—, (a)each of those homes must be looked at separately to see if the secondautomatic UK test is met, and, (b)the second automatic UK test is then met so long as it is met in relationto at least one of those homes., 9(1)The third automatic UK test is that—, (a)P works sufficient hours in the UK, as assessed over a period of 365 days,, (b)during that period, there are no significant breaks from UK work,, (c)all or part of that period falls within year X,, (d)more than 75% of the total number of days in the 365-day period on which Pdoes more than 3 hours’ work are days on which P does more than 3 hours’ workin the UK, and, (e)at least one day which falls in both that period and year X is a day onwhich P does more than 3 hours’ work in the UK., (2)Take the following steps to work out, for any given period of 365 days,whether P works “sufficient hours in the UK” as assessed over that period—,   * _Step 1_, Identify any days in the period on which P does more than 3 hours’ workoverseas, including ones on which P also does work in the UK on the same day., The days so identified are referred to as “disregarded days”.,   * _Step 2_, Add up (for all employments held and trades carried on by P) the total numberof hours that P works in the UK during the period, but ignoring any hours thatP works in the UK on disregarded days., The result is referred to as P’s “net UK hours”.,   * _Step 3_, Subtract from 365—, (a), the total number of disregarded days, and, (b), any days that are allowed to be subtracted, in accordance with the rules inparagraph 28 of this Schedule, to take account of periods of leave and gapsbetween employments., The result is referred to as the “reference period”.,   * _Step 4_, Divide the reference period by 7. If the answer is more than 1 and is not awhole number, round down to the nearest whole number. If the answer is lessthan 1, round up to 1.,   * _Step 5_, Divide P’s net UK hours by the number resulting from step 4., If the answer is 35 or more, P is considered to work “sufficient hours in theUK” as assessed over the 365-day period in question., (3)This paragraph does not apply to P if—, (a)P has a relevant job on board a vehicle, aircraft or ship at any time inyear X, and, (b)at least 6 of the trips that P makes in year X as part of that job arecross-border trips that either begin in the UK, end in the UK or begin and endin the UK., 10(1)The fourth automatic UK test is that—, (a)P dies in year X,, (b)for each of the previous 3 tax years, P was resident in the UK by virtue ofmeeting the automatic residence test,, (c)even assuming P were not resident in the UK for year X, the tax yearpreceding year X would not be a split year as respects P (see Part 3 of thisSchedule),, (d)when P died, either—, (i)P’s home was in the UK, or, (ii)P had more than one home and at least one of them was in the UK, and, (e)if P had a home overseas during all or part of year X, P did not spend asufficient amount of time there in year X., (2)In relation to a home of P’s overseas, P “spent a sufficient amount oftime” there in year X if—, (a)there were at least 30 days in year X when P was present there on that dayfor at least some of the time (no matter how short a time), or, (b)P was present there for at least some of the time (no matter how short atime) on each day of year X up to and including the day on which P died., (3)In sub-paragraph (2)—, (a)the reference to 30 days is to 30 days in aggregate, whether the days wereconsecutive or intermittent, and, (b)the reference to P being present at the home is to P being present there ata time when it was a home of P’s., (4)If P had more than one home overseas—, (a)each of those homes must be looked at separately to see if the requirementof sub-paragraph (1)(e) is met, and, (b)that requirement is then met so long as it is met in relation to each ofthem., #### The automatic overseas tests, 11There are 5 automatic overseas tests., 12The first automatic overseas test is that—, (a)P was resident in the UK for one or more of the 3 tax years preceding yearX,, (b)the number of days in year X that P spends in the UK is less than 16, and, (c)P does not die in year X., 13The second automatic overseas test is that—, (a)P was resident in the UK for none of the 3 tax years preceding year X, and, (b)the number of days that P spends in the UK in year X is less than 46., 14(1)The third automatic overseas test is that—, (a)P works sufficient hours overseas, as assessed over year X,, (b)during year X, there are no significant breaks from overseas work,, (c)the number of days in year X on which P does more than 3 hours’ work in theUK is less than 31, and, (d)the number of days in year X falling within sub-paragraph (2) is less than91., (2)A day falls within this sub-paragraph if—, (a)it is a day spent by P in the UK, but, (b)it is not a day that is treated under paragraph 23(4) as a day spent by Pin the UK., (3)Take the following steps to work out whether P works “sufficient hoursoverseas” as assessed over year X—,   * _Step 1_, Identify any days in year X on which P does more than 3 hours’ work in the UK,including ones on which P also does work overseas on the same day., The days so identified are referred to as “disregarded days”.,   * _Step 2_, Add up (for all employments held and trades carried on by P) the total numberof hours that P works overseas in year X, but ignoring any hours that P worksoverseas on disregarded days., The result is referred to as P’s “net overseas hours”.,   * _Step 3_, Subtract from 365 (or 366 if year X includes 29 February)—, (a), the total number of disregarded days, and, (b), any days that are allowed to be subtracted, in accordance with the rules inparagraph 28 of this Schedule, to take account of periods of leave and gapsbetween employments., The result is referred to as the “reference period”.,   * _Step 4_, Divide the reference period by 7. If the answer is more than 1 and is not awhole number, round down to the nearest whole number. If the answer is lessthan 1, round up to 1.,   * _Step 5_, Divide P’s net overseas hours by the number resulting from step 4., If the answer is 35 or more, P is considered to work “sufficient hoursoverseas” as assessed over year X., (4)This paragraph does not apply to P if—, (a)P has a relevant job on board a vehicle, aircraft or ship at any time inyear X, and, (b)at least 6 of the trips that P makes in year X as part of that job arecross-border trips that either begin in the UK, end in the UK or begin and endin the UK., 15(1)The fourth automatic overseas test is that—, (a)P dies in year X,, (b)P was resident in the UK for neither of the 2 tax years preceding year Xor, alternatively, P’s case falls within sub-paragraph (2), and, (c)the number of days that P spends in the UK in year X is less than 46., (2)P’s case falls within this sub-paragraph if—, (a)P was not resident in the UK for the tax year preceding year X, and, (b)the tax year before that was a split year as respects P because thecircumstances of the case fell within Case 1, Case 2 or Case 3 (see Part 3 ofthis Schedule)., 16(1)The fifth automatic overseas test is that—, (a)P dies in year X,, (b)P was resident in the UK for neither of the 2 tax years preceding year Xbecause P met the third automatic overseas test for each of those years or,alternatively, P’s case falls within sub-paragraph (2), and, (c)P would meet the third automatic overseas test for year X if paragraph 14were read with the relevant modifications., (2)P’s case falls within this sub-paragraph if—, (a)P was not resident in the UK for the tax year preceding year X because Pmet the third automatic overseas test for that year, and, (b)the tax year before that was a split year as respects P because thecircumstances of the case fell within Case 1 (see Part 3 of this Schedule)., (3)The relevant modifications of paragraph 14 are—, (a)in sub-paragraph (1)(a) and (b) and sub-paragraph (3), for “year X” read“the period from the start of year X up to and including the day before theday of P’s death”, and, (b)in step 3 of sub-paragraph (3), for “365 (or 366 if year X includes 29February)” read “the number of days in the period from the start of year X upto and including the day before the day of P’s death”., #### The sufficient ties test, 17(1)The sufficient ties test is met for year X if—, (a)P meets none of the automatic UK tests and none of the automatic overseastests, but, (b)P has sufficient UK ties for that year., (2)“UK ties” is defined in Part 2 of this Schedule., (3)Whether P has “sufficient” UK ties for year X will depend on—, (a)whether P was resident in the UK for any of the previous 3 tax years, and, (b)the number of days that P spends in the UK in year X., (4)The Tables in paragraphs 18 and 19 show how many ties are sufficient ineach case., #### Sufficient UK ties, 18The Table below shows how many UK ties are sufficient in a case where P wasresident in the UK for one or more of the 3 tax years preceding year X—, Days spent by P in the UK in year X| Number of ties that are sufficient  ---|---  More than 15 but not more than 45| At least 4  More than 45 but not more than 90| At least 3  More than 90 but not more than 120| At least 2  More than 120| At least 1    19The Table below shows how many UK ties are sufficient in a case where P wasresident in the UK for none of the 3 tax years preceding year X—, Days spent by P in the UK in year X| Number of ties that are sufficient  ---|---  More than 45 but not more than 90| All 4  More than 90 but not more than 120| At least 3  More than 120| At least 2    20(1)If P dies in year X, paragraph 18 has effect as if the words “More than15 but” were omitted from the first column of the Table., (2)In addition to that modification, if the death occurs before 1 March inyear X, paragraphs 18 and 19 have effect as if each number of days mentionedin the first column of the Table were reduced by the appropriate number., (3)The appropriate number is found by multiplying the number of days, in eachcase, by—, [![](/ukpga/2013/29/images/ukpga_20130029_en_039)](/ukpga/2013/29/images/ukpga_20130029_en_039?view=plain), where “A” is the number of whole months in year X after the month in which Pdies., (4)If, for any number of days, the appropriate number is not a whole number,the appropriate number is to be rounded up or down as follows—, (a)if the first figure after the decimal point is 5 or more, round theappropriate number up to the nearest whole number,, (b)otherwise, round it down to the nearest whole number., ### PART 2Key concepts, #### Introduction, 21This Part of this Schedule defines some key concepts for the purposes ofthis Schedule., #### Days spent, 22(1)If P is present in the UK at the end of a day, that day counts as a dayspent by P in the UK., (2)But it does not do so in the following two cases., (3)The first case is where—, (a)P only arrives in the UK as a passenger on that day,, (b)P leaves the UK the next day, and, (c)between arrival and departure, P does not engage in activities that are toa substantial extent unrelated to P’s passage through the UK., (4)The second case is where—, (a)P would not be present in the UK at the end of that day but for exceptionalcircumstances beyond P’s control that prevent P from leaving the UK, and, (b)P intends to leave the UK as soon as those circumstances permit., (5)Examples of circumstances that may be “exceptional” are—, (a)national or local emergencies such as war, civil unrest or naturaldisasters, and, (b)a sudden or life-threatening illness or injury., (6)For a tax year—, (a)the maximum number of days to which sub-paragraph (2) may apply in relianceon sub-paragraph (4) is limited to 60, and, (b)accordingly, once the number of days within sub-paragraph (4) reaches 60(counting forward from the start of the tax year), any subsequent days withinthat sub-paragraph, whether involving the same or different exceptionalcircumstances, will count as days spent by P in the UK., 23(1)If P is not present in the UK at the end of a day, that day does notcount as a day spent by P in the UK., (2)This is subject to the deeming rule., (3)The deeming rule applies if—, (a)P has at least 3 UK ties for a tax year,, (b)the number of days in that tax year when P is present in the UK at somepoint in the day but not at the end of the day (“qualifying days”) is morethan 30, and, (c)P was resident in the UK for at least one of the 3 tax years preceding thattax year., (4)The deeming rule is that, once the number of qualifying days in the taxyear reaches 30 (counting forward from the start of the tax year), eachsubsequent qualifying day in the tax year is to be treated as a day spent by Pin the UK., (5)The deeming rule does not apply for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)(a)(so, in deciding for those purposes whether P has a 90-day tie, qualifyingdays in excess of 30 are not to be treated as days spent by P in the UK)., #### Days spent “in” a period, 24Any reference to a number of days spent in the UK “in” a given period is areference to the total number of days spent there (in aggregate) in thatperiod, whether continuously or intermittently., #### Home, 25(1)A person’s home could be a building or part of a building or, forexample, a vehicle, vessel or structure of any kind., (2)Whether, for a given building, vehicle, vessel, structure or the like,there is a sufficient degree of permanence or stability about P’s arrangementsthere for the place to count as P’s home (or one of P’s homes) will depend onall the circumstances of the case., (3)But somewhere that P uses periodically as nothing more than a holiday homeor temporary retreat (or something similar) does not count as a home of P’s., (4)A place may count as a home of P’s whether or not P holds any estate orinterest in it (and references to “having” a home are to be read accordingly)., (5)Somewhere that was P’s home does not continue to count as such merelybecause P continues to hold an estate or interest in it after P has moved out(for example, if P is in the process of selling it or has let or sub-let it,having set up home elsewhere)., #### Work, 26(1)P is considered to be “working” (or doing “work”) at any time when P isdoing something—, (a)in the performance of duties of an employment held by P, or, (b)in the course of a trade carried on by P (alone or in partnership)., (2)In deciding whether something is being done in the performance of duties ofan employment, regard must be had to whether, if value were received by P fordoing the thing, it would fall within the definition of employment income insection 7 of ITEPA 2003., (3)In deciding whether something is being done in the course of a trade,regard must be had to whether, if expenses were incurred by P in doing thething, the expenses could be deducted in calculating the profits of the tradefor income tax purposes., (4)Time spent travelling counts as time spent working—, (a)if the cost of the journey could, if it were incurred by P, be deducted incalculating P’s earnings from that employment under section 337, 338, 340 or342 of ITEPA 2003 or, as the case may be, in calculating the profits of thetrade under ITTOIA 2005, or, (b)to the extent that P does something else during the journey that woulditself count as work in accordance with this paragraph., (5)Time spent undertaking training counts as time spent working if—, (a)in the case of an employment held by P, the training is provided or paidfor by the employer and is undertaken to help P in performing duties of theemployment, and, (b)in the case of a trade carried on by P, the cost of the training could bededucted in calculating the profits of the trade for income tax purposes., (6)Sub-paragraphs (4) and (5) have effect without prejudice to the generalityof sub-paragraphs (2) and (3)., (7)Assume for the purposes of sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) that P is someone whois chargeable to income tax under ITEPA 2003 or ITTOIA 2005., (8)A voluntary post for which P has no contract of service does not count asan employment for the purposes of this Schedule., #### Location of work, 27(1)Work is done where it is actually done, regardless of where theemployment is held or the trade is carried on by P., (2)But work done by way of or in the course of travelling to or from the UK byair or sea or via a tunnel under the sea is assumed to be done overseas evenduring the part of the journey in or over the UK., (3)For these purposes, travelling to or from the UK is taken to—, (a)begin when P boards the aircraft, ship or train that is bound for adestination in the UK or (as the case may be) overseas, and, (b)end when P disembarks from that aircraft, ship or train., (4)This paragraph is subject to express provisions in this Schedule about thelocation of work done by people with relevant jobs on board vehicles, aircraftor ships., #### Rules for calculating the reference period, 28(1)This paragraph applies in calculating the “reference period” (which is astep taken in determining whether P works “sufficient hours in the UK” or“sufficient hours overseas” as assessed over a given period of days)., (2)The number of days in the given period may be reduced to take account of—, (a)reasonable amounts of annual leave or parenting leave taken by P during theperiod (for all employments held and trades carried on by P during the period,whether in the UK or overseas),, (b)absences from work at times during the period when P is on sick leave andcannot reasonably be expected to work as a result of the illness or injury inquestion, and, (c)non-working days embedded within a block of leave for which a reduction ismade under paragraph (a) or (b)., (3)But no reduction may be made in respect of any day that is a “disregardedday” (see paragraphs 9(2) and 14(3) in Part 1 of this Schedule)., (4)For any particular employment or trade, “reasonable” amounts of annualleave or parenting leave are to be assessed having regard to (among otherthings)—, (a)the nature of the work, and, (b)the country or countries where P is working., (5)Non-working days are “embedded within” a block of leave only if there are,as part of that block of leave—, (a)at least 3 consecutive days of leave taken before the non-working day orseries of non-working days in question, and, (b)at least 3 consecutive days of leave taken after the non-working day orseries of non-working days in question., (6)A “non-working day” is any day of the week, month or year on which P—, (a)is not normally expected to work (according to P’s contract of employmentor usual pattern of work), and, (b)does not in fact work., (7)In calculating the reductions to be made under sub-paragraph (2)—, (a)if it turns out, after applying sub-paragraph (3), that the reasonableamounts of annual leave or parenting leave or, as the case may be, theabsences from work on sick leave do not add up (across the period) to a wholenumber of days, the number in that case is to be rounded down to the nearestwhole number, but, (b)any such rounding is to be ignored for the purposes of sub-paragraph(2)(c)., (8)If—, (a)P changes employment during the given period,, (b)there is a gap between the two employments, and, (c)P does not work at all at any time between the two employments,, the number of days in the given period may be reduced by the number of days inthat gap., (9)But—, (a)if the gap lasts for more than 15 days, only 15 days may be subtracted, and, (b)if there is more than one change of employment during the period, themaximum number of days that may be subtracted under sub-paragraph (8) for allthe gaps in total is 30., #### Significant breaks from UK or overseas work, 29(1)There is a “significant break from UK work” if at least 31 days go by andnot one of those days is—, (a)a day on which P does more than 3 hours’ work in the UK, or, (b)a day on which P would have done more than 3 hours’ work in the UK but forbeing on annual leave, sick leave or parenting leave., (2)There is a “significant break from overseas work” if at least 31 days go byand not one of those days is—, (a)a day on which P does

of sub-paragraph (3)(a), it does not matter whether thetrip ends on that same day., (6)A day that falls within both paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) of sub-paragraph (3) is to be treated as if it fell only within paragraph (a)., (7)In the case of a cross-border trip to or from the UK that is undertaken instages—, (a)the day on which the trip begins or, as the case may be, ends is the day onwhich the stage of the trip that involves crossing the UK border begins orends, and, (b)accordingly, any day on which a stage is undertaken by P solely within theUK must (if it lasts for more than 3 hours)
