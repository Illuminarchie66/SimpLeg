        "text": "\nPART 5General anti-abuse rule\n\tGeneral anti-abuse rule\n\t\tThis Part has effect for the purpose of counteracting tax advantagesarising from tax arrangements that are abusive.\n\t\tThe rules of this Part are collectively to be known as \u201cthe general anti-abuse rule\u201d.\n\t\tThe general anti-abuse rule applies to the following taxes\u2014\n\t\t\tincome tax,\n\t\t\tcorporation tax, including any amount chargeable as if it were corporationtax or treated as if it were corporation tax,\n\t\t\tcapital gains tax,\n\t\t\tpetroleum revenue tax,\n\t\t\tinheritance tax,\n\t\t\tstamp duty land tax, and\n\t\t\tannual tax on enveloped dwellings.\n\tMeaning of \u201ctax arrangements\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d\n\t\tArrangements are \u201ctax arrangements\u201d if, having regard to all thecircumstances, it would be reasonable to conclude that the obtaining of a taxadvantage was the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of thearrangements.\n\t\tTax arrangements are \u201cabusive\u201d if they are arrangements the entering intoor carrying out of which cannot reasonably be regarded as a reasonable courseof action in relation to the relevant tax provisions, having regard to all thecircumstances including\u2014\n\t\t\twhether the substantive results of the arrangements are consistent with anyprinciples on which those provisions are based (whether express or implied)and the policy objectives of those provisions,\n\t\t\twhether the means of achieving those results involves one or more contrivedor abnormal steps, and\n\t\t\twhether the arrangements are intended to exploit any shortcomings in thoseprovisions.\n\t\tWhere the tax arrangements form part of any other arrangements regard mustalso be had to those other arrangements.\n\t\tEach of the following is an example of something which might indicate thattax arrangements are abusive\u2014\n\t\t\tthe arrangements result in an amount of income, profits or gains for taxpurposes that is significantly less than the amount for economic purposes,\n\t\t\tthe arrangements result in deductions or losses of an amount for taxpurposes that is significantly greater than the amount for economic purposes,and\n\t\t\tthe arrangements result in a claim for the repayment or crediting of tax(including foreign tax) that has not been, and is unlikely to be, paid,\n\t\t\t\tbut in each case only if it is reasonable to assume that such a result was notthe anticipated result when the relevant tax provisions were enacted.\n\t\tThe fact that tax arrangements accord with established practice, and HMRChad, at the time the arrangements were entered into, indicated its acceptanceof that practice, is an example of something which might indicate that thearrangements are not abusive.\n\t\tThe examples given in subsections (4) and (5) are not exhaustive.\n\tMeaning of \u201ctax advantage\u201d\n\t\tA \u201ctax advantage\u201d includes\u2014\n\t\t\trelief or increased relief from tax,\n\t\t\trepayment or increased repayment of tax,\n\t\t\tavoidance or reduction of a charge to tax or an assessment to tax,\n\t\t\tavoidance of a possible assessment to tax,\n\t\t\tdeferral of a payment of tax or advancement of a repayment of tax, and\n\t\t\tavoidance of an obligation to deduct or account for tax.\n\tCounteracting the tax advantages\n\t\tIf there are tax arrangements that are abusive, the tax advantages thatwould (ignoring this Part) arise from the arrangements are to be counteractedby the making of adjustments.\n\t\tThe adjustments required to be made to counteract the tax advantages aresuch as are just and reasonable.\n\t\tThe adjustments may be made in respect of the tax in question or any othertax to which the general anti-abuse rule applies.\n\t\tThe adjustments that may be made include those that impose or increase aliability to tax in any case where (ignoring this Part) there would be noliability or a smaller liability, and tax is to be charged in accordance withany such adjustment.\n\t\tAny adjustments required to be made under this section (whether by anofficer of Revenue and Customs or the person to whom the tax advantage wouldarise) may be made by way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment,amendment or disallowance of a claim, or otherwise.\n\t\tBut\u2014 \n\t\t\tno steps may be taken by an officer of Revenue and Customs by virtue ofthis section unless the procedural requirements of Schedule 43 have beencomplied with, and\n\t\t\tthe power to make adjustments by virtue of this section is subject to anytime limit imposed by or under any enactment other than this Part.\n\t\tAny adjustments made under this section have effect for all purposes.\n\tConsequential relieving adjustments\n\t\tThis section applies where\u2014\n\t\t\tthe counteraction of a tax advantage under section 209 is final, and\n\t\t\tif the case is not one in which notice of the counteraction was given underparagraph 12 of Schedule 43, HMRC have been notified of the counteraction bythe taxpayer.\n\t\tA person has 12 months, beginning with the day on which the counteractionbecomes final, to make a claim for one or more consequential adjustments to bemade in respect of any tax to which the general anti-abuse rule applies.\n\t\tOn a claim under this section, an officer of Revenue and Customs must makesuch of the consequential adjustments claimed (if any) as are just andreasonable.\n\t\tConsequential adjustments\u2014\n\t\t\tmay be made in respect of any period, and\n\t\t\tmay affect any person (whether or not a party to the tax arrangements).\n\t\tBut nothing in this section requires or permits an officer to make aconsequential adjustment the effect of which is to increase a person\u2019sliability to any tax.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section\u2014\n\t\t\tif the claim relates to income tax or capital gains tax, Schedule 1A to TMA1970 applies to it;\n\t\t\tif the claim relates to corporation tax, Schedule 1A to TMA 1970 (and notSchedule 18 to FA 1998) applies to it;\n\t\t\tif the claim relates to petroleum revenue tax, Schedule 1A to TMA 1970applies to it, but as if the reference in paragraph 2A(4) of that Schedule toa year of assessment included a reference to a chargeable period within themeaning of OTA 1975 (see section 1(3) and (4) of that Act);\n\t\t\tif the claim relates to inheritance tax it must be made in writing to HMRCand section 221 of IHTA 1984 applies as if the claim were a claim under thatAct;\n\t\t\tif the claim relates to stamp duty land tax or annual tax on envelopeddwellings, Schedule 11A to FA 2003 applies to it as if it were a claim towhich paragraph 1 of that Schedule applies.\n\t\tWhere an officer of Revenue and Customs makes a consequential adjustmentunder this section, the officer must give the person who made the claimwritten notice describing the adjustment which has been made.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section the counteraction of a tax advantage isfinal when the adjustments made to effect the counteraction, and any amountsarising as a result of those adjustments, can no longer be varied, on appealor otherwise.\n\t\tAny adjustments required to be made under this section may be made\u2014\n\t\t\tby way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment, the amendmentof a claim, or otherwise, and\n\t\t\tdespite any time limit imposed by or under any enactment other than thisPart.\n\t\tIn this section \u201cthe taxpayer\u201d, in relation to a counteraction of a taxadvantage under section 209, means the person to whom the tax advantage wouldhave arisen.\n\tProceedings before a court or tribunal\n\t\tIn proceedings before a court or tribunal in connection with the generalanti-abuse rule, HMRC must show\u2014\n\t\t\tthat there are tax arrangements that are abusive, and\n\t\t\tthat the adjustments made to counteract the tax advantages arising from thearrangements are just and reasonable.\n\t\tIn determining any issue in connection with the general anti-abuse rule, acourt or tribunal must take into account\u2014\n\t\t\tHMRC\u2019s guidance about the general anti-abuse rule that was approved by theGAAR Advisory Panel at the time the tax arrangements were entered into, and\n\t\t\tany opinion of the GAAR Advisory Panel about the arrangements (seeparagraph 11 of Schedule 43).\n\t\tIn determining any issue in connection with the general anti-abuse rule, acourt or tribunal may take into account\u2014\n\t\t\tguidance, statements or other material (whether of HMRC, a Minister of theCrown or anyone else) that was in the public domain at the time thearrangements were entered into, and\n\t\t\tevidence of established practice at that time.\n\tRelationship between the GAAR and priority rules\n\t\tAny priority rule has effect subject to the general anti-abuse rule(despite the terms of the priority rule).\n\t\tA \u201cpriority rule\u201d means a rule (however expressed) to the effect thatparticular provisions have effect to the exclusion of, or otherwise inpriority to, anything else.\n\t\tExamples of priority rules are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe rule in section 464, 699 or 906 of CTA 2009 (priority of loanrelationships rules, derivative contracts rules and intangible fixed assetsrules for corporation tax purposes), and\n\t\t\tthe rule in section 6(1) of TIOPA 2010 (effect to be given to doubletaxation arrangements despite anything in any enactment).\n\tConsequential amendment\n\t\tSection 42 of TMA 1970 (procedure for making claims etc) is amended asfollows.\n\t\tIn subsection (2), for \u201c(3ZB)\u201d substitute \u201c(3ZC)\u201d.\n\t\tAfter subsection (3ZB) insert\u2014\n\t\t\t\u201c(3ZC)Subsection (2) also does not apply in relation to any claim undersection 210 of the Finance Act 2013 (claims for consequential relievingadjustments after counteraction of tax advantage under the general anti-abuserule).\u201d\n\tInterpretation of Part 5\n\t\tIn this Part\u2014\n\t\t  * \u201cabusive\u201d, in relation to tax arrangements, has the meaning given by section 207(2) to (6); \n\t\t  * \u201carrangements\u201d includes any agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions (whether or not legally enforceable); \n\t\t  * \u201cthe

meaning given by section 208; \n\t\t  * \u201ctax arrangements\u201d has the meaning given by section 207(1). \n\tCommencement and transitional provision\n\t\tThe general anti-abuse rule has effect in relation to any tax arrangementsentered into on or after the day on which this Act is passed.\n\t\tWhere the tax arrangements form part of any other arrangements entered intobefore that day those other arrangements are to be ignored for the purposes ofsection 207(3), subject to subsection (3).\n\t\tAccount is to be taken of those other arrangements for the purposes ofsection 207(3) if, as a
