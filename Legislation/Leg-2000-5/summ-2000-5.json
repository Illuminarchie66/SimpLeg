Here's a simplified version of the long title:\nThis act helps the UK government make sure that nuclear materials are used safely and securely. It gives the government the power to ask for information about nuclear activities, check that people are following the rules, and take action if they don't. The act also lets the government search certain places if they think there might be a problem with nuclear safety. If someone provides false information, they could get in trouble.\nThe act sets up a regulatory framework for nuclear materials, so everything is clear and organized. It's important to follow the rules to keep everyone safe!"
