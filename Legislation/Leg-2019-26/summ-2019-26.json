This law was made because the UK government and the EU couldn't agree on when the UK should leave the EU.",

    "summary": "The European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019 is a law that helps the UK government figure out how to leave the European Union (EU). Here's what the law says:\n\n1. The UK government has to tell Parliament about any agreements they make with the EU during the negotiation process. They need to do this by giving statements in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\n\n2. If the UK government can't get an extension to the time limit set by the EU for leaving the union, they have to ask for one by writing a letter to the President of the European Council by October 19th, 2019.\n\n3. The UK Prime Minister needs to give updates on how the negotiations are going every 28 days after that until either an agreement is reached or Parliament decides otherwise.\n\nSo basically, this law tells the UK government what they need to do to leave the EU and how long they have to do it in. It also requires them to keep updating Parliament on their progress.",
