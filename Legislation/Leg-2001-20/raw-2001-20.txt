(a)as if (notwithstanding anything in section 136(1) of the Income andCorporation Taxes Act 1988) the replacement right were or, as the case may be,were part of the valuable consideration given for the assignment or release;and, 
(b)as if the value of so much of that consideration as is represented by thereplacement right were equal to whichever is the smaller of the followingamounts—, 
(i)the amount which (in accordance with the provisions of section 135(3)(a) ofthat Act) would have been taken to be the gain realised by an exercise in fullof the original right immediately before the time of its assignment orrelease; and, 
(ii)the amount which (in accordance with those provisions) would have beentaken to be the amount of the gain realised by an exercise in full of thereplacement right at that time which falls immediately after it is given inconsideration of the assignment or release.,

but those paragraphs shall have effect (instead) as if they provided for theamount of any such liability to be determined, or to be deemed to have beendetermined in accordance with the following provisions of this section., 
(6)Subject to subsection (), so much of section 136(1) of the Income andCorporation Taxes Act 1988 (charge to tax in roll-over cases) as provides forsections 135 and 136 of that Act to apply as mentioned in section 136(1) ofthat Act in relation to the replacement right, or in relation to anysubsequent replacement right, shall be deemed to have effect (or, as the casemay be, to have had effect) for the purposes of the determination mentioned insubsection (5) of this section—,

(b)that references in subsection (4) of this section to the original right andto the replacement right are references, respectively, to the right that isassigned or released and to the right comprised in the consideration for theassignment or release; and,

(10)For the purposes of this section shares are additional shares, in relationto any right (“the new right”) constituting or comprised in the considerationfor the assignment or release of another right (“the old right”), to theextent that they are shares obtainable in exercise of the new right inaddition to shares obtainable in exercise of the new right with a value thatmatches the value of the shares (other than any that were themselvesadditional shares) which were obtainable by the exercise of the old right., 
(11)For the purposes of subsection (10) shares obtainable by the exercise ofthe new right shall be taken to have a value that matches the value of theshares obtainable in exercise of the old right to the extent, and to theextent only, that the following amounts are the same—, 
(a)the amount which (in accordance with the provisions of section 135(3)(a) ofthe Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) would be taken to be the amount ofthe gain realised by an exercise of the new right at the relevant time(assuming it to be exercisable at that time) for obtaining the shares; and, 
(b)the amount which would have been taken (in accordance with thoseprovisions) to be the gain realised by a full exercise of the old rightimmediately before the time of its assignment or release;, 
and in this subsection “the relevant time”, in relation to the new right,means the time which falls immediately after it is given in consideration ofthe assignment or release of the old right., 
(12)Where any question arises for the purposes of this Act, in relation to anypartial exercise, assignment or release of any right, whether the sharesobtainable under so much of the right as has been exercised, assigned orreleased were additional shares, it shall be assumed that the right in so faras it is a right to acquire additional shares must be exercised, assigned orreleased before the exercise, assignment or release of any part of that rightthat is a right to acquire shares that are not additional shares., 
(13)All such apportionments as may be necessary shall be made in determiningfor the purposes of this section, in a case in which the number of additionalshares cannot be a whole number, to what extent a liability to pay Class 1contributions arises in relation to the exercise, assignment or release of aright to acquire any such shares., 
(14)Nothing in this section shall apply (where the replacement right wasgranted on or before 7th November 2000) for determining the amount of anyspecial contribution payable under section 2.,

(a)all such repayments shall be made as may be necessary by virtue of thatsubsection; but, 
(b)any amount which it would otherwise be necessary to repay in respect of asecondary Class 1 contribution paid by a person who has become liable to pay aspecial contribution under section 2 may be retained and set against anyundischarged liability of his to pay that special contribution., 
(16)In this section references to a subsequent replacement right arereferences to any right to acquire shares in a body corporate which are orhave been obtained by any person as, or as part of, the consideration for theassignment or release by him of the replacement right or of a subsequentreplacement right.,

(a)as if the election mentioned in subsection (1)(b) of this section were inforce, with the effect mentioned in subsection (1)(b) of that section, at anytime when the earner becomes or became chargeable to tax on a gain realised onthe exercise, assignment or release of the right, and, 
(b)as if the reference in subsection (2)(b) of that section to any liabilitythat has become the earner’s by virtue of that election included any liabilityof his, in consequence of the giving of the notice under section 1 of thisAct, to pay a special contribution under section 2 of this Act., 
(3)Nothing in section 187A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 shallhave the effect, or be deemed to have had the effect, of conferring any reliefin respect of any liability which is prevented from arising, or is treated asnot having arisen, by virtue of subsection (1)(a) or (b) or (4) of section 2of this Act., 
(4)In section 203FB(6A) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988(application of PAYE provisions) the reference to relief likely to beavailable under section 187A shall be treated as not including a reference toany relief available by virtue of this section in respect of liability to paya special contribution under section 2 of this Act.,
