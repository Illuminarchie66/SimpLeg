    "general": "The Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 is a law that helps protect people's privacy and personal freedoms. It does several things to achieve this goal:\n\nFirstly, it makes sure that the police and other authorities can only keep certain types of evidence (like fingerprints) for as long as they need to, and then they must destroy it. This helps prevent unnecessary storage of private information.\n\nSecondly, it requires the police to get permission from adults before collecting their biometric data (like facial recognition data). This helps protect children's privacy and ensures that adults are aware of how their data is being used.\n\nThirdly, it sets out rules for the use of surveillance cameras, like CCTV, to ensure that they are used fairly and with proper oversight.\n\nFourthly, it introduces new laws to help protect vulnerable groups, such as victims of human trafficking and stalking.\n\nLastly, it makes some changes to existing laws to improve freedom of information and the handling of personal data by public authorities.",
