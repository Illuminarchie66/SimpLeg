It sets out rules for social workers to follow when they help families with young children, especially if there are concerns about the child's safety. The law also makes sure that adoptive parents get the right training and support before they can adopt a child from another country. Additionally, it ensures that all parties involved in adoption processes undergo thorough background checks to guarantee the well-being of the children.",
