It lets courts review punishments given to soldiers who broke rules. If the court finds there was a mistake, they can change the punishment.\n2. It gives the government the power to change or cancel punishments given by commanding officers if they didn't have the authority to do so.\n3. It allows for appeals in cases where the original punishment was unfair or incorrect.\n4. It ensures that local councils and other organizations provide support for veterans and their families when accessing services like housing, education, and healthcare.\n5. It updates existing laws to ensure they align with modern practices and includes provisions for managing property seized from service personnel.\n\nIn short, the Armed Forces Act 2021 improves the way the military handles discipline and ensures that veterans receive proper support when accessing essential services."
