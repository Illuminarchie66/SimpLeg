Specifically, it focuses on two types of nuisances: insects and artificial light.\n* Statutory nuisance: Insects - Section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 is amended to include insects emanating from industrial, trade, or business premises as a statutory nuisance, provided they are prejudicial to health or a nuisance. This change aims to address issues related to insect infestations originating from commercial properties.\n* Statutory nuisance: Artificial Light - Subsection (1)(fa) of Section 79 is added to include artificial light emitted from premises as a statutory nuisance, provided it is prejudicial to health or a nuisance. This change targets excessive or poorly directed lighting that causes inconvenience or harm.\n* Definition of Relevant Premises - Definitions for \"industrial, trade or business premises\" and \"relevant separate railway premises\" are updated to clarify their meanings. These definitions are essential for determining which premises are subject to the new provisions regarding statutory nuisances.\n* Exceptions for Certain Premises - Subsections (2) and (5B) provide exceptions for certain premises, such as airports, harbour premises, railway premises, tramway premises, bus stations, public service vehicle operating centres, goods vehicle operating centres, lighthouses, and prisons. These exceptions aim to minimize the impact of the new provisions on critical infrastructure and public services.\n* Consent Requirements - Subsection (8) specifies that the consent of the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales is required before taking proceedings for certain statutory nuisances. This ensures that the authorities can address nuisances affecting important installations or facilities while avoiding potential disruptions or conflicts.\n* Supplementary Provisions - Sections 101 and 102 make additional clarifications and updates to the law, including the definition of \"outdoor relevant sports facility\" and the requirement for best practicable means in summary proceedings. These provisions ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of the new statutory nuisance provisions."
