    "general": "This act was passed in 2001 to help fight against terrorism and other forms of crime. It gives police and other authorities more power to stop people who might be planning to commit crimes, and to punish those who do commit crimes. The act also makes it easier to freeze the assets of people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities. Additionally, it deals with issues related to immigration and asylum seekers, and makes changes to the laws around these areas. Finally, it allows for the retention of certain types of communication data to help solve crimes and protect public safety.",
