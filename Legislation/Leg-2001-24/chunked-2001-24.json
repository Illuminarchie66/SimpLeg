condition is that each of them falls within paragraph(a) or (b) of subsection (3); and different persons may fall within differentparagraphs.\n\t\tContents of order\n\t\t\tA freezing order is an order which prohibits persons from making fundsavailable to or for the benefit of a person or persons specified in the order.\n\t\t\tThe order must provide that these are the persons who are

named in the order, or\n\t\t\t\tfalling within a description of persons set out in the order.\n\t\t\tThe description must be such that a reasonable person would know whether hefell within it.\n\t\t\tFunds are financial assets and economic benefits of any kind.\n\t\tContents: further provisions\n\t\t\tSchedule 3 contains further provisions about the contents of freezing

yearsstarting with the day on which it is made.\n\tInterpretation\n\t\tNationals and residents\n\t\t\tA national of the United Kingdom is an individual who is\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta British citizen, a

applies for the purposes of this Part.\n\tOrders: procedure etc.\n\t\tProcedure for making freezing orders\n\t\t\tA power to make a freezing order is exercisable by statutory instrument.\n\t\t\tA freezing order\u2014\n\t\t\t\tmust be laid before Parliament after being made;\n\t\t\t\tceases to have effect at the end of the relevant period unless before theend of that period the order is approved by a resolution of each House ofParliament (but without that affecting anything done under the order or thepower to make a new order).\n\t\t\tThe relevant period is a period of 28 days starting with the day on whichthe order is made.\n\t\t\tIn calculating the relevant period no account is to be taken of any timeduring which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which both Housesare adjourned for more than 4 days.\n\t\t\tIf the Treasury propose to make a freezing order in the belief that thecondition in section 4(2)(b) is satisfied, they must not make the order unlessthey consult the Secretary of State.\n\t\tProcedure for making certain amending orders\n\t\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta freezing order is made specifying by description (rather than by name)the person or persons to whom or for whose benefit funds are not to be madeavailable,\n\t\t\t\tit is proposed to make a further order which amends the freezing order onlyso as to make it specify by name the person or persons (or any of the persons)to whom or for whose benefit funds are not to be made available, and\n\t\t\t\tthe Treasury reasonably believe that the person or persons named fallwithin the description contained in the freezing order and the further ordercontains a statement of the Treasury\u2019s belief.\n\t\t\tThis section also applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta freezing order is made specifying by name the person or persons to whomor for whose benefit funds are not to be made available,\n\t\t\t\tit is proposed to make a further order which amends the freezing order onlyso as to make it specify by name a further person or further persons to whomor for whose benefit funds are not to be made available, and\n\t\t\t\tthe Treasury reasonably believe that the further person or persons fallwithin the same description as the person or persons specified in the freezingorder and the further order contains a statement of the Treasury\u2019s belief.\n\t\t\tThis section also applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta freezing order is made, and\n\t\t\t\tit is proposed to make a further order which amends the freezing order onlyso as to make it specify (whether by name or description) fewer persons towhom or for whose benefit funds are not to be made available.\n\t\t\tIf this section applies, a statutory instrument containing the furtherorder is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House ofParliament.\n\t\tProcedure for revoking orders\n\t\t\tA statutory instrument containing an order revoking a freezing order (withoutre-enacting it) is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of eitherHouse of Parliament.\n\t\tDe-hybridisation \n\t\t\tIf apart from this section an order under this Part would be treated for thepurposes of the standing orders of either House of Parliament as a hybridinstrument, it is to proceed in that House as if it were not such aninstrument.\n\t\tOrders: supplementary\n\t\t\tWhere this Part confers a power to make provision, different provision maybe made for different purposes.\n\t\t\tAn order under this Part may include supplementary, incidental, saving ortransitional provisions.\n\t\t\tNothing in this Part affects the generality of subsection (2).\n\tMiscellaneous\n\t\tThe Crown\n\t\t\tA freezing order binds the Crown, subject to the following provisions ofthis section.\n\t\t\tNo contravention by the Crown of a provision of a freezing order makes theCrown criminally liable; but the High Court or in Scotland the Court ofSession may, on the application of a person appearing to the Court to have aninterest, declare unlawful any act or omission of the Crown which constitutessuch a contravention.\n\t\t\tNothing in this section affects Her Majesty in her private capacity; andthis is to be construed as if section 38(3) of the Crown Proceedings Act [1947(c. 44)](/id/ukpga/1947/44?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\") (meaning ofHer Majesty in her private capacity) were contained in this Act.\n\t\tRepeals \n\t\t\tThese provisions shall cease to have effect\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 2 of the Emergency Laws (Re-enactments and Repeals) Act [1964 (c.60)](/id/ukpga/1964/60?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\") (Treasury\u2019spower to prohibit action on certain orders as to gold etc);\n\t\t\t\tsection 55 of the Finance Act [1968 (c. 44)](/id/ukpga/1968/44?view=plain\"Go to item of legislation\") (meaning of security in section 2 of 1964 Act).\n\t\t\tSubsection (1) does not affect a reference which\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis to a provision referred to in that subsection, and\n\t\t\t\tis contained in a provision made under an Act."
