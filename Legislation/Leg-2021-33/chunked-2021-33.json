**References to Article 23A benchmarks**\n\t\t1.A reference to a benchmark in a contract or other arrangement is, at anytime when the benchmark is an Article 23A benchmark, to be treated for allpurposes as including the benchmark as it exists\u2014\n\t\t\twhen it is an Article 23A benchmark,\n\t\t\twhen the FCA has exercised a power under Article 23D(2) in respect of thebenchmark, and\n\t\t\twhen the benchmark administrator has exercised a discretion or permissionconferred on it by the FCA under Article 23D in respect of the benchmark,\n\t\t\twhether or not the benchmark is representative of the Article 27 market oreconomic reality at those times.\n\t\t\t2.If a contract or other arrangement describes a benchmark or other figure(rather than naming a benchmark), paragraph 1 applies as if the descriptionwere a reference to\u2014\n\t\t\teach benchmark that falls within the description, and\n\t\t\teach Article 23A benchmark that fell, or was being treated by the partiesto the contract or arrangement as falling, within the description immediatelybefore it became an Article 23A benchmark.\n\t\t\t3.For the purposes of paragraph 2(b), where the description is of a benchmarkor other figure that measures, or is intended to measure, a market or economicreality, a benchmark fell within the description immediately before it becamean Article 23A benchmark if its Article 27 market or economic reality fellwithin the description.\n\t\t\t4.Paragraphs 1 and 2 apply\u2014\n\t\t\tto any contract or other arrangement, whenever it was formed, and\n\t\t\tto any reference to a benchmark or other figure, however expressed.\n\t\t\t5.Where paragraph 1 applies in a case in which the reference formed part ofthe contract or other arrangement\u2014\n\t\t\timmediately before this Article came into force, or\n\t\t\timmediately before the benchmark became an Article 23A benchmark,\n\t\t\tthe contract or arrangement is to be treated for all purposes as having alwaysprovided for the reference to have the meaning provided for by paragraph 1(and, where relevant, paragraph 2) when the benchmark is an Article 23Abenchmark.\n\t\t\t6.Nothing in this Article is to be taken to create any right, obligation orliability of a party to a contract or other arrangement or of another person\u2014\n\t\t\tin relation to an act or omission that is relevant to the formation orvariation of the contract or arrangement (such as, among other things, an actor omission in connection with the making of a representation or the giving ofadvice), where the formation or variation took place before the benchmark inquestion became an Article 23A benchmark, or\n\t\t\tin relation to the operation of the contract or arrangement before thebenchmark in question became an Article 23A benchmark.\n\t\t\t7.Nothing in this Article is to be taken to extinguish, or otherwise affect,any cause of action that arose in relation to a contract or arrangement beforethe benchmark in question became an Article 23A benchmark, except that theeffect of this Article is to be taken into account when determining any lossor damage incurred.\n\t\t\t8.This Article has effect subject to Article 23FB and any regulations madeunder that Article.\n\t\t\t9.For the purposes of this Article and Article 23FB, a contract or otherarrangement refers to a benchmark if it refers to an index, whether or not theindex is used as a benchmark for the purposes of the contract or arrangement(and references to a benchmark are to be
