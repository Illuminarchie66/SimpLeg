    "summary": "The Civil Defence (Grant) Act 2002 gives money to organizations in England and Wales to help them prepare for emergencies like natural disasters or terrorist attacks. The government decides how much money each organization gets based on their needs and how well they manage their funds. Organizations have to pay back any extra money they get. This law only applies to the financial year that ends on March 31st, 2003, and future years, but it doesn't apply to Northern Ireland.\nThis law helps keep communities safe by giving them the resources they need to prepare for emergencies. It also ensures that organizations use their funding wisely and don't receive more than they need. By understanding this law, citizens can feel safer knowing that their community is better prepared for unexpected events.",
