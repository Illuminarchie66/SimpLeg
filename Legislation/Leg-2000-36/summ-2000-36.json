    "summary": "The Freedom of Information Act 2000 gives anyone the right to ask for information held by public authorities, like the government or local councils. They must give you the information if they have it, unless it falls into one of several categories where it might be kept secret, like national security or legal professional privilege. If you think they've got it wrong, you can appeal to an independent tribunal. The Act covers all public authorities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, but there are some special rules for Scotland.\nIf you want to know more about the Act or how it works, you can contact the Information Commissioner's Office, which oversees the Act and helps people with their requests. Remember, though, that not everything is available \u2013 some things might be too sensitive or private, or might be protected by law. But in general, the Act is designed to make sure that public authorities are open and transparent in their dealings with the public."
