\u201cvariation order\u201d).\n\t\tThe court must refuse to hear an application for a variation order if itconsiders that the applicant does not have a sufficient interest in thedetermination of the application.\n\tEffect of variation order\n\t\tA variation order does not affect an interest in property acquired as aresult of a declaration under this Act (but see section 7).\n\t\tA variation order does not revive a marriage or civil partnership that wasbrought to an end by virtue of a declaration under this Act.\n\t\tExcept as otherwise required by subsection (1) or (2)\u2014\n\t\t\twhere a variation order varies a declaration, subsections (1) and (2) ofsection 3 have effect in relation to the declaration as varied by the order,and\n\t\t\twhere a variation order revokes a declaration, those subsections cease tohave effect in relation to the declaration.\n\t\tBut subsection (3) applies only if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe variation order has not been appealed against and the period forbringing an appeal has ended, or\n\t\t\tthe variation order has been appealed against and the appeal (and anyfurther appeal) has been unsuccessful.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (4), an appeal has been unsuccessful if\u2014\n\t\t\tit has been dismissed or withdrawn, and\n\t\t\tany period for bringing a further appeal has ended.\n\tOther functions of court making variation order\n\t\tWhen making a variation order, the court may\u2014\n\t\t\tdetermine any question which relates to an interest in property and arisesas a result of the variation order, and\n\t\t\tdetermine the domicile of the missing person at the time of his or herpresumed death.\n\t\tWhen making a variation order, the court must make such further order (ifany) as it considers reasonable in relation to any interest in propertyacquired as a result of the declaration varied or revoked by the order (\u201ctheoriginal declaration\u201d) (but see subsections (3), (5) and (6)).\n\t\tThe court must not make an order under subsection (2) if the applicationfor the variation order was made after the end of the period of 5 yearsbeginning with the day on which the original declaration was made, unless itconsiders that there are exceptional circumstances which make it appropriateto do so.\n\t\tIn considering what order to make under subsection (2), the court must, asfar as practicable, have regard to the principles in section 8.\n\t\tAn order under subsection (2) does not affect income that accrued in theperiod\u2014\n\t\t\tbeginning with the day on which the original declaration was made, and\n\t\t\tending with the day on which the variation order was made.\n\t\tAn order under subsection (2) does not affect or provide grounds tochallenge\u2014\n\t\t\ta related good faith transaction, or\n\t\t\tan interest in property acquired under such a transaction.\n\t\tA \u201crelated good faith transaction\u201d is a transaction under which a personacquires an interest in the property that is the subject of the order (or anypart of it) in good faith and for value from\u2014\n\t\t\ta person who acquired an interest in the property (or any part of it) as aresult of the original declaration, or\n\t\t\ta person who acquired an interest in the property (or any part of it) froma person described in paragraph (a), whether directly or indirectly.\n\t\tWhere a person has entitlement under a trust by virtue of an order undersubsection (2), the trustee is liable to that person for any loss suffered bythat person on account of any breach of trust by the trustee in theadministration or distribution of all or part of the property that is thesubject of the order.\n\t\tSubsection (8) does not apply to the extent that the trustee\u2019s liability isrestricted under any enactment or by any provision in a deed regulating theadministration of the trust.\n\t\tIn subsection (9) \u201cenactment\u201d includes an enactment contained in\u2014\n\t\t\tan instrument made under an Act, or\n\t\t\tan Act or Measure of the National Assembly for Wales or an instrument madeunder such an Act or Measure.\n\tPrinciples \n\t\tThese are the principles referred to in section 7(4).\n\t\tThe first principle is relevant where property (\u201cthe relevant property\u201d) isbeing or has been administered under a trust.\n\t\tThe first principle is that\u2014\n\t\t\ta person who, but for section 6(1), would have an interest in the relevantproperty by virtue of a variation order, and\n\t\t\ta person who, but for section 6(1), would have acquired an interest in therelevant property from a person described in paragraph (a),\n\t\t\t\tshould be entitled to have made over to him or her by the trustee in fullsatisfaction of that interest the things listed in subsection (4).\n\t\tThose things are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe interest in the relevant property or an equivalent interest in propertyrepresenting the relevant property, to the extent that such property is stillin the hands of the trustee when the variation order is made, and\n\t\t\tthe value of the interest in the relevant property, to the extent that suchproperty has been distributed.\n\t\tThe second principle is relevant where an insurer has paid a capital sum asa result of a declaration varied or revoked by a variation order.\n\t\tThe second principle is that the capital sum, or any part of the capitalsum, should be repaid to the insurer if the facts in respect of which thevariation order was made justify such repayment.\n\t\tThe references in subsections (5) and (6) to a capital sum do not include acapital sum distributed by way of an annuity or other periodical payment."
