    "summary": "The Northern Ireland (Welfare Reform) Act 2015 allows the UK government to change laws related to social security and child support maintenance in Northern Ireland without needing to pass new legislation. This means that the government can make changes quickly and easily if needed. The changes can include new laws, changes to existing laws, or even creating new crimes and punishments. However, before making any changes, the government needs to get approval from both houses of parliament. This act applies to all of the UK, including England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. It came into effect when it was passed, but any changes made through Orders in Council cannot be made after December 31st, 2016. In short, this law gives the UK government more flexibility to make changes to welfare and child support policies in Northern Ireland.",
