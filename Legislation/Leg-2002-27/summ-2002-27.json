    "general": "This law allows courts to end both a religious marriage and a civil divorce at the same time, making it easier for couples who were married in a religious ceremony to get a divorce. Before this law was passed, couples had to go through two separate legal processes - one to end their religious marriage and another to get a civil divorce. This new law simplifies the process by allowing the court to handle both aspects of the divorce in one step.",

    "summary": "The Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002 ensures that couples who want to get a divorce must first dissolve their religious marriage. This means that if one partner does not agree to the divorce, the other partner cannot simply obtain a civil divorce without resolving the religious marriage. Before granting a civil divorce, the court may request proof that the religious marriage has been ended. This law protects the rights of both partners and ensures that the divorce process is fair and just. Additionally, the Lord Chancellor has the authority to create rules governing the termination of religious marriages, which can be changed by Parliament if necessary.",
