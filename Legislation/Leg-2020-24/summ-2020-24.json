    "summary": "The Private International Law (Implementation of Agreements) Act 2020 helps make sure that laws from other countries work well in the UK. It does this by implementing international agreements about private international law, like the Hague Conventions from 1996, 2005, and 2007. These agreements help sort out things like divorce, child custody, and inheritance when people move around and have connections to different countries.\n\nThis act makes these agreements into UK law so they can be used in courts here. It also lets the government make rules to put the agreements into practice and share information between countries. The act covers all of the UK - England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland - and can even be used in the Isle of Man if the government there wants to use it too.\n\nThe act will start working on \"IP completion day,\" which means when everything else is ready. But some parts might start working right away, like the part that lets the government make rules. So, this act will help make sure that the UK's private international law works smoothly and fairly for everyone involved!",
