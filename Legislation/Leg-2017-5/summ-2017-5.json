Before, there was a limit on how much could be given, but now the limit has been raised so the government can provide more support for development projects. This will allow them to do more to improve living standards and create opportunities for people in these countries.",

Now, they can give up to \u00a36,000 million! This means more money for businesses that need it. But, the government still needs to follow some rules when giving out this money. They have to tell Parliament about any new rules they make, so everyone knows what's going on. So, if you run a business and need some extra cash, you might be able to get some help from the government thanks to this new law!",
