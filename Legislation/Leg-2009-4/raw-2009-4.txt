and gains of deficitperiod, (1)The basic rule is that the deficit must be set off against any income andgains of the deficit period which are referable to BLAGAB., (2)The income and gains are reduced

profits forthe period (see subsection (4)), less the unused part of the relevantdeductions for the period (see subsection (5))., (2)If an accounting period ending within the permitted period begins beforeit, only a part of the amount which would otherwise be the available profitfor that accounting period is available profit., (3)That part is so much as is proportionate to the part of the accountingperiod in the permitted period., (4)References in this section to a company’s BLAGAB non-trading loanrelationships profits for an accounting period are references to the amount(if any) which is chargeable to tax for that period under section 299 (chargeto tax on non-trading profits) for the company’s BLAGAB., (5)The unused part of the relevant deductions for an accounting period isfound

and, (b), so much of the sum of the deductions made in the case of the company inrespect of charges on income for that period as is so referable.,   * _Step 2_, Add together—, (a), the total amounts so referable which could be applied for the period in makingdeductions as a result of section 76 of ICTA if the company’s BLAGAB non-trading loan relationships profits for the period were disregarded, and, (b), the total amounts so referable which could be applied for the period in makingdeductions in respect of charges on income if those profits were disregarded.,   * _Step 3_, Subtract the amount found at Step 2 from the amount found at Step 1., The result is the unused part of the relevant deductions for the accountingperiod., (6)In the case of any claim under section 389, the reference in Step 1(a) insubsection (5) to the expenses deduction for an accounting period given byStep 8 in section 76(7) of ICTA and the reference in Step 2(a) in subsection(5) to the deduction for expenses as a result of section 76 of ICTA for anaccounting period are references to the deduction for expenses that would havebeen made as a result of that section for that period on the assumptions insubsections

(8)The second assumption is that all such adjustments are made as are requiredas a result of any sum having been carried back under the Corporation Tax Actsto the accounting period mentioned in

any particular category of the company’s long-term business is determined as follows., (3)In the case of credits and debits within the rules in section 394, thatsection applies., (4)In the case of other credits and debits, the relevant fraction of thecredits or debits is referable to a category of long-term business., (5)That fraction is determined by applying section 432A(6) to (6B) and (8) ofICTA (apportionment of income and gains) as if—, (a)the credits or debits were income not directly referable to any category ofbusiness, and, (b)the references in section 432A(6) to assets directly

by thearrangements which are liabilities relating to those categories., (6)For the purposes of subsection (5) “relevant proportion”, in relation toreinsured liabilities of any particular category of business, means theaverage of—, (a)the proportion of all the reinsured liabilities that are liabilitiesrelating to that category at the beginning of the period of account, and, (b)the proportion of all the reinsured liabilities that are liabilitiesrelating to that category at the end of that period., (7)Debits relating to interest payable in respect of the late payment of anybenefits are

where subsection (1)(c)(ii) applies, a proportion of the exchangegain or loss must be left out of account in determining those credits ordebits., (4)That proportion is the proportion that the part of the loan that is treatedas if it had not been made bears to the whole of the loan., (5)Nothing in Schedule 28AA to ICTA requires the amounts brought into accountunder this Part in respect of exchange gains or losses from loan relationshipsto be calculated on the assumption that the arm’s length provision had beenmade instead of the actual provision., (6)But subsection (5) does not affect the application of subsections (2) and(3) under subsection (1)., (7)In this section “the arm’s length provision” and “the actual provision”have the same meaning as in Schedule 28AA to ICTA (see paragraph

##### 449Exchange gains and losses on creditor relationships: no correspondingdebtor relationship, (1)This section applies if—, (a)a company has a creditor relationship in an accounting period, and, (b)an exchange gain or loss arises in the period in respect of an assetrepresenting the relationship., (2)The exchange gain or loss must be left out of account in determining thecredits or debits to

relevant transaction been dealing at arm’s length, the amountof the loan would have been an amount (“the arm’s length amount”) greater thannil, but less than its actual amount., (2)Accordingly, an exchange gain or loss which arises in the accounting periodin respect of an asset representing the creditor relationship is not requiredby that section to be left out of account., (3)But if—, (a)the circumstances are as mentioned in subsection (1), and, (b)there is no corresponding debtor relationship,, only a proportion of the exchange gain or loss may be taken into account indetermining the credits or debits to be brought into account for the purposesof this Part., (4)That proportion is the proportion which the arm’s length amount bears tothe actual amount of the loan., (5)In this section—,   * “corresponding debtor relationship” has the same meaning as in section 449 (see section 450), and ,   * “the relevant transaction” means the transaction giving rise to the loan as a result of which the company has the creditor relationship in the accounting period in question. , ##### 452Exchange gains and losses where loan not on arm’s length terms, (1)This subsection applies

representing that debtorrelationship., (3)Subsections (4) and (5) apply if—, (a)because of a claim made under paragraph 6D(2) of Schedule 28AA to ICTA morethan one company is treated for any purpose as having a debtor relationshiprepresented by the same liability, or, (b)because of the claim that is assumed to be made under subsection (2) morethan one company is so treated., (4)The total amount of the credits brought into account for the purposes ofthis Part in respect of exchange gains from those debtor relationships mustnot exceed the total amount of the debits brought into account for thosepurposes in respect of exchange losses from the corresponding creditorrelationship., (5)The total amount of the debits brought into account for those purposes inrespect of exchange losses from those debtor relationships must not exceed thetotal amount of the credits brought into account for those purposes in respectof exchange gains from the corresponding creditor relationship., (6)Section 466 (companies connected for an accounting period) applies for thepurposes of this section., #### Connected parties deriving benefit from creditor relationships, ##### 453Connected parties deriving

relationship, or, (ii)otherwise in connection with the relationship, and, (c)that benefit is designed to represent some or all of the amount by whichthe return to A from the relationship is less than a commercial return., (2)The credits to be brought into account by A in respect of the relationshipfor the purposes of this Part are to be determined on the basis of fair valueaccounting., (3)The fair value of A’s rights under the relationship must include the fairvalue of the benefit which is derived by B as a result of the arrangements., (4)In determining the return to A from the relationship for the purposes ofsubsection (1)(a), any benefit which A derives directly or indirectly from thebenefit derived by B as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) is ignored., (5)In this section—,   * “arrangements” includes any agreement or understanding, whether or not it is legally enforceable, ,   * “benefit” includes value in any form, and ,   * “commercial return” means a return on an investment of money at a commercial rate of interest. , #### Tax advantages from resetting interest rates (“reset bonds”), ##### 454Application of fair value accounting: reset bonds etc, (1)This section applies if—, (a)a

relationship are to be determined using fairvalue accounting., (5)In determining the fair value of an asset for any purpose of this section,it is assumed that all amounts payable by the debtor will be paid in full asthey fall due., (6)For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), it does not matter for whom theadvantage is secured., #### Disposals for consideration not fully recognised by accounting

forward from the deficit period as is not thesubject of a claim under section 458(1) must be set off against the non-trading profits of the company for the next accounting period after thedeficit period., (4)Those profits are reduced accordingly., (5)In this Chapter “non-trading profits”, in relation to a company, means somuch of the company’s profits as does not consist of trading income for

(b)an amount which falls to be carried forward and set against non-tradingprofits of later accounting periods under section 457(1)., (5)Accordingly, section 457 and this section apply as if the first laterperiod were the deficit period., #### 459Claim to set off deficit against profits of deficit period or earlierperiods, (1)The company may make a claim for the whole or part of the deficit—, (a)to

off deficit against other profits for the deficit period, (1)This section applies if a claim is made under section 459(1)(a) for thewhole or part of the deficit to be set off against profits for the deficitperiod., (2)The general rule is that the amount to which the claim relates must be setoff against the profits of the company for the deficit period which areidentified in the claim., (3)Those profits are reduced accordingly., (4)The general rule is subject to subsections (5) and (7)., (5)Relief for any deficit incurred in a trade in an earlier accounting periodmust be given before relief under this section., (6)But relief under this section must be given before relief is given againstprofits for the deficit period—, (a)under section 392A(1) or 393A(1) of ICTA (losses set against profits forthe same or earlier accounting periods), or, (b)as a result of a claim under section 459(1)(b) (carry-back) in respect of adeficit for a later period., (7)No relief may be given under this section against ring fence profits of thecompany within the meaning of Chapter 5 of Part 12 of ICTA (petroleumextraction activities)., #### 462Claim to carry back deficit to earlier accounting periods, (1)This section applies if a claim is made under 459(1)(b) for the whole orpart of the deficit to be carried back to be set off against profits foraccounting periods before the deficit

(b)the total amount of the profits available for relief under this section., (3)Section 463 explains which profits are so available., (4)The amount to which the claim relates is set off against those profits bytreating them as reduced accordingly., (5)If those profits are profits for more than one accounting period, therelief is applied by setting off the amount to which the claim relates againstprofits for a later period before setting off any remainder of that amountagainst profits for an earlier period., #### 463Profits available for relief under section 462, (1)The profits available for relief under section 462 are the amounts which(apart from the relief) would be charged under this Part as profits foraccounting periods ending within the permitted period, after giving

provides must be given before relief under section 462. , (3)If an accounting period ending within the permitted period begins beforeit, only a part of the amount which (apart from the relief) would bechargeable under this Part for that period, after giving every prior relief,is available for relief under section 462., (4)That part is so much as is proportionate to the part of the accountingperiod in the permitted period., (5)The reliefs which must be given before relief under section 462 are—, (a)relief as a result of a claim under section 459(1)(a) (claim for deficit tobe set

would be inthe case of an actual amount of such profits or losses., (4)Subsection (5) applies if under Schedule 28AA to ICTA an amount is treatedas expenses incurred by a company under or for the purposes of any of itsderivative contracts or related transactions., (5)Debits relating to the amount are to be brought into account in accordancewith this Part to the same extent as they would be in the case of an actualamount of such expenses., ##### 694Exchange gains and losses, (1)Subsections (2) to (7) apply if—, (a)a company is a party to a derivative contract in an accounting period, and,

accounting period are left out of account in determining the creditsand debits to be brought into account in accordance with this Part., (4)Subsection (5) applies if as a result of Schedule 28AA to ICTA thecompany’s profits and losses are calculated for tax purposes as if the termsof the contract were those which would have been agreed by the company and theother party to the contract had they been dealing at arm’s length (“the arm’slength terms”)., (5)The credits and debits which are to be brought into account in accordancewith this Part in the case of the company are to be determined on theassumption that the amount of any exchange gain or loss arising to the companyfrom the contract in the accounting period is the adjusted amount., (6)In subsection (5), the “adjusted amount” means the amount of an exchangegain or loss which would have arisen from the contract if its terms were thearm’s length terms., (7)That amount may be nil., (8)Nothing in Schedule 28AA to ICTA requires the amounts brought into accountin accordance with this Part in respect of exchange gains and losses fromderivative contracts to be calculated on the assumption that the arm’s lengthprovision had been made instead of the actual provision., (9)But subsection (8) does not affect the application of—, (a)subsection (3) under subsection (2), or, (b)subsection (5) under subsection (4)., (10)In subsection

chargeable to corporation tax in accordance with this Part inrespect of the derivative contract., (2)A must bring into account a credit of the appropriate amount in respect ofthe derivative contract for the accounting period in which the option expiredor would have expired if none of the rights under it had been exercised., (3)If the option expired, “the appropriate amount” means amount X., (4)If any rights under the option were exercised (in whole or in part), “theappropriate amount” means amount X less so much of it as is referable, on ajust and reasonable basis, to the rights which have been so exercised., (5)In determining for the purposes of subsection (1)(d) whether there is atransfer of value, the assumption in subsection (6) is made., (6)That assumption is that if there had not been a connection between A and B—, (a)all the rights under the option would have been exercised in full, and, (b)all of those rights would have been exercised on the latest date on whichthey were exercisable., (7)In this section “option” is to be construed as if section 580(2) and (3)(meaning of “option”) were omitted., (8)For the purposes of this section, B is a connected company in relation

NR are both a partyto a derivative contract which makes provision for notional interest payments,the credits and debits which fall to be brought into account in accordancewith this Part in respect of the contract in the case of A do not include theamount of any excluded debit in relation to that contract., (3)The amount of an excluded debit is calculated by determining for theaccounting period the amount (if any) by which—, (a)the sum of any notional interest payments made by A to NR while A and NRare both a party to the contract,, exceeds, (b)the sum of any notional interest payments made by NR to A during that time., (4)For the purposes of this section, a payment is a notional interest paymentif—, (a)a derivative contract specifies—, (i)a notional principal amount,, (ii)a period, and, (iii)a rate of interest,, (b)the amount of the payment is determined (wholly or mainly) by applying arate to the specified notional principal amount for the specified period, and, (c)the value of the

that isbrought into account for accounting purposes by the debtor is disregarded forthe purposes of this Part., (3)Any other gain in respect of an unpaid debt in respect of an intangiblefixed asset that is brought into account by the debtor for accounting purposesis treated for the purposes of section 721 (receipts recognised as theyaccrue) as a gain in respect of an intangible fixed asset.,

beginning of that accounting periodat a cost equal to its value recognised for accounting purposes at that time., (3)The “first relevant accounting period” is the first accounting period—, (a)in respect of which an apportionment under section 747(3) of ICTA falls tobe made, or, (b)which is an ADP exempt period., (4)It is assumed that the company—, (a)has not claimed any relief under Chapter 7 (roll-over relief in case ofreinvestment), or, (b)made any provisional declaration of entitlement to such relief,, and accordingly paragraph 4(1) of Schedule 24 to ICTA (assumption that allavailable

of the later period,and, (b)no election has been made in respect of the asset under section 730(writing down at fixed rate: election for fixed-rate basis)., (2)If there is an increase in that value, a corresponding credit must bebrought into account for tax purposes in the later period., (3)If there is a decrease in that value, a corresponding debit must be broughtinto account for tax purposes in the later period., (4)The amount of the credit or debit is—, [![](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_040)](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_040?view=plain), where—,   * D is the accounting difference, ,   * WDVE is the tax written-down value of the asset at the end of the earlier period, and ,   * AVE is the accounting value of the asset at the end of the earlier period. , (5)But if

period,less, (b)the debit., (4)After the relevant time the cost recognised for tax purposes is the sum of—, (a)the tax written-down value given by subsection (2) or (3), and, (b)the cost recognised for tax purposes of any subsequent expenditure on theasset that is capitalised for accounting purposes., (5)After the relevant time the tax written-down value is determined takingaccount only of

accounting values of the resulting assets at the beginningof the later period,, (c)no election under section 730 (writing down at fixed rate: election forfixed-rate basis) has been or is subsequently made in respect of the originalasset, and, (d)no such election is subsequently made in respect of any of the resultingassets., (2)If the accounting difference is an increase, a corresponding credit must bebrought into account for tax purposes in the later period., (3)If the accounting difference is a decrease, a corresponding debit must bebrought into account for tax purposes in the later period., (4)The credit or debit is—, [![](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_041)](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_041?view=plain), where—,   * D is the accounting difference, ,   * WDVE is the tax written-down value of the original asset at the end of the earlier period, and ,   * AVE is the accounting value of that asset at the end of that period. , (5)But if subsection (2) applies the credit must not exceed—, (a)the sum of the debits brought into account for tax purposes in respect ofthe original asset before the later period, less, (b)the sum of the credits so brought into account., (6)This section is subject to section 878 (exclusion of credits or debitsbrought into account under other provisions)., ##### 875Effect of application of section 874 in later period and subsequently, (1)A credit or debit that is required to be brought into account under section874 is treated as arising at the beginning of the later period (“the relevanttime”)., (2)If section 874(2) applies, the tax written-down value of each resultingasset at the relevant time is—, [![](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_042)](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_042?view=plain), where—,

time, and ,   * TAV is the sum of the accounting values of all the resulting assets at the relevant time. , (3)If section 874(3) applies, the tax written-down value of each resultingasset at the relevant time is—, [![](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_043)](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_043?view=plain), where—,   * WDVE, AV and TAV have the same meaning as in subsection (2), and ,   * D is the debit. , (4)After the relevant time the cost recognised for tax purposes for eachresulting asset is taken to be the sum of—, (a)the tax written-down value given by subsection (2) or, as the case may be,subsection (3), and, (b)the cost recognised for tax purposes of any subsequent expenditure on theasset that is capitalised for accounting purposes., (5)After the relevant time

applies if—, (a)the change of accounting policy results in an intangible fixed asset of thecompany that was treated as one asset (“the original asset”) in the earlierperiod being treated as two or more assets (“the resulting assets”) in thelater period, and, (b)an election under section 730 (writing down at fixed rate: election forfixed-rate basis) has been or is subsequently made in respect of the originalasset., (2)That election has effect—, (a)in relation to the original asset, for periods up to and including theearlier period, and, (b)in relation to each of the resulting assets, for the later period andsubsequent periods., (3)The tax written-down value of each resulting asset at the beginning of thelater period (“the relevant time”) is—,

period, ,   * AVL is the accounting value of the asset in question at the beginning of the later period, and ,   * TAVL is the sum of the accounting values of all the resulting assets at the beginning of that period. , (4)After the relevant time the cost recognised for tax purposes for eachresulting asset is the sum of—, (a)the tax written-down value given by subsection (3), and, (b)the cost recognised for tax purposes of any subsequent expenditure on theasset that is capitalised for accounting purposes., (5)After the relevant time the tax written-down value for each resulting assetis determined taking account only of subsequent credits and debits., ##### 877Election for fixed-rate writing down in relation to resulting asset, (1)This section applies if—, (a)the change of accounting policy results in an intangible fixed asset of thecompany that was treated as one asset (“the original undivided asset”) in theearlier period being treated as two or more assets (“the resulting assets”) inthe later period, and, (b)no election under section 730 (writing down at fixed rate: election forfixed-rate basis) has been or is subsequently made in respect of the originalundivided asset., (2)An election under that section may be made in respect of any of theresulting assets., (3)But such an election may be made only within the period during which suchan election could have been made in relation to the original undivided asset., (4)The effect of the election is that—, (a)the original undivided asset is treated as if it had at all material timesconsisted of as many assets (“notional original assets”) as there areresulting assets,, (b)each notional original asset is taken to be the same asset as one of theresulting assets (its “corresponding resulting asset”),, (c)the appropriate proportion of every amount falling to be taken into accountin relation to the original undivided asset is attributed to each of thenotional original assets, and, (d)this Part applies in relation to each of the notional original assets andits corresponding resulting asset accordingly., (5)For the purposes of subsection (4)(c) the appropriate proportion of everyamount falling to be

the company had that interest (seesections 949 to 951).,   * _Step 2_, If the estate is a UK estate in relation to any tax year by reference to whichthe amount of that share for any accounting period is determined under section950, deduct from that amount income tax on that amount at the applicable ratefor that year (see section 952).,   * _Step 3_, Add together the amounts found under step 1 after making any deductionsnecessary under step 2.,   * _Step 4_, Add together the basic amounts relating to the company’s absolute interest inrespect of which the company was liable for corporation tax for all previousaccounting periods (or would have been so liable if the company had been acompany liable for corporation tax for those accounting periods)., (2)For the purposes of this Chapter the

this section “excess deductions from the previous tax year” means somuch of the allowable deductions for the previous tax year as exceeded theaggregate income of the estate for that year., ##### 950Shares of residuary income of estate, (1)In the case of a company which has an absolute interest in the whole of theresidue of an estate for a whole tax year, the company’s share of theresiduary

residue of an estate for partof the tax year, or, (b)an absolute interest in part of the residue of an estate for the whole orpart of the tax year,, the company’s share of the residuary income of the estate for that year is aproportionate part of that income for that year., (3)The company’s share of the residuary income of an estate in respect of anabsolute interest for each of the accounting periods (if more than one)comprising a tax year is found by apportioning the company’s share of theresiduary income of the estate for that year between the accounting periods., (4)Subsections (1) and

interest in the whole orpart of the residue of an estate at the end of the administration period and—, (a)the total of the company’s shares of the residuary income of the estate inrespect of that interest for all tax years (apart from this section), exceeds, (b)the total of all sums paid during or payable at the end of theadministration period in respect of that interest to any person (grossed upwhere subsection (5) applies)., (2)In the final accounting period the company’s share of the residuary incomeof the estate is to be reduced by that excess., (3)If that excess is greater than the company’s share of that income for thefinal accounting period, the company’s share of that income for the previousaccounting period is to be reduced, and so on., (4)If subsection (3) applies, all necessary adjustments and repayments ofcorporation tax are to be made., (5)For the purposes of calculating the total mentioned in subsection (1)(b)—, (a)if the estate is a UK estate in relation to a tax year in which a sum ispaid, the sum is to be grossed up by reference to the basic rate for thatyear, and, (b)if the estate is a UK estate in relation to the final tax year, a sumpayable at the end of the administration period is to be grossed up byreference to the basic rate for that year., (6)For the application of this section where two or more absolute interests inthe whole or the same part of the residue are held successively by differentpersons, see section 954(5) and (6)., ##### 952Applicable rate for determining assumed income entitlement (UKestates), (1)The applicable rate by reference to which income tax on a company’s shareof the residuary income of the estate is calculated for the purposes of step 2of the calculation in section 948(1) depends on the rate at which income taxis borne by the aggregate income of the estate for the tax year in question., (2)If the aggregate income of the estate all bears income tax at the samerate, the applicable rate is that rate., (3)If different parts of the aggregate income of the estate bear income tax atdifferent rates, the applicable rate is the rate that applies to the income towhich the company’s share of the residuary income of the estate relates., (4)If different rates apply to different parts of that income, each of thoserates is the applicable rate that applies to the corresponding part of theincome to which the company’s share of the residuary income of the estaterelates., (5)For the purposes of this section, if there is more than one person with anabsolute interest in the residue of the estate, such apportionments of partsof the aggregate income of the estate bearing income tax at different ratesare to be made as are just and reasonable for their different interests., (6)Section 650(1) of ITTOIA

that interest for any accounting period is to be treated as including theshare of any person with a previous such interest (“a previous holder”), and, (b)the basic amounts relating to the later holder’s interest are to be treatedas including the basic amounts relating to any previous such interest., (3)In applying subsection (2), all determinations under that subsection orsection 955(2) that fall to be made in relation to a person with an earlierinterest are to be made before determinations under those provisions relatingto a person with a later interest., (4)A company which is a previous holder in the final accounting period is tobe taxed for that period, in relation to the interest as to which that companyis a previous holder, as if that period were not the final accounting period,and the later holder’s assumed income entitlement is to be calculatedaccordingly (or, where the previous holder is not a company, having regard tothe application of section 671(4) of ITTOIA 2005 to the previous holder)., (5)The calculation under section 951(1)(a) and (b) (amount of reduction in theshare of the residuary income of the company with an absolute interest at theend of the administration period) is to be made by reference to all theabsolute interests taken together., (6)If the amount resulting from that calculation is greater than the totalamount of the reductions which can be made under section 951(2) and (3), theshare of the residuary income of the estate of the last previous holder of theinterest for the last accounting period in which that last holder had thatinterest is to be reduced, and so on., (7)But if subsection (6) applies in a case where the last previous holder orany earlier previous holder is not a company, in applying that subsectionregard must be had to the application of section 671(6) of ITTOIA 2005 to theprevious holder., ##### 955Assumed income entitlement of holder of absolute interest followinglimited interest, (1)This section

limitedinterest., (2)Rules A and B apply to determine in relation to such an absolute interest—, (a)whether the company with the interest has an assumed income entitlement inrespect of the interest, and, (b)if so, its amount., (3)Rule A is that the company’s share of the residuary income of the estate inrespect of the absolute interest for any accounting period is treated asincluding any amount which would be included in it if—, (a)the interest had subsisted throughout the period when any such limitedinterest subsisted, and, (b)no such limited interest had ever subsisted., (4)Rule B is that the basic amounts relating to the absolute interest aretreated as including the basic amounts relating to any such limited interest., ##### 956Payments in respect of limited interests followed by

interests preceding that interest is a limitedinterest., (2)A sum to which a company (“C”) with such an absolute interest is entitledin respect of any such limited interest which is paid while C has the absoluteinterest is treated as paid in respect of the absolute interest (and not thelimited interest)., (3)Subsection (4) applies if—, (a)C’s absolute interest ceases during the administration period, and, (b)a sum to which C is entitled in respect of any such limited interest—, (i)is paid after the absolute interest ceases but before the end of theadministration period, or, (ii)remains payable at the end of it., (4)This Chapter applies as respects any such sum as if the limited interesthad continued to subsist while that absolute interest subsisted and had beenheld by C.,
