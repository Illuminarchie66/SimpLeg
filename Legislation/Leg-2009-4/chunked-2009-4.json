animal\u201d) is sold from the herd or otherwise ceases tobe part of the herd, and\n\t\t\tit is replaced in the herd by another animal (\u201cthe new animal\u201d).\n\t\tThe sale proceeds (if any) of the old animal are brought into account as areceipt.\n\t\tBut this needs to be read with\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 115 (amount of receipt if old animal slaughtered under diseasecontrol

farmer in rearing the animal to maturity, and\n\t\t\tin the case of an animal acquired by the farmer but not for valuableconsideration, the sum of the market value of the animal when acquired and thecost (if any) incurred by the farmer in rearing the animal to maturity.\n\tSale of whole or substantial part of herd\n\t\tThis section applies for the purpose of calculating the profits of thetrade if, either all at once or over a period not longer than 12 months, theherd or a substantial part of the herd is sold unless\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 118 applies (acquisition of new herd begun within 5

the difference had been sold fromthe old herd.\n\t\tIf the number of animals in the new herd is larger than the number ofanimals in the old herd, section 113 (addition of animals to herd) applies asif a number of animals equal to the difference had been added to the old herd.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section\u2014\n\t\t\tif the difference between the number of animals in the new herd and

that is treated as a result of section 118(2)as if it replaced an animal sold (\u201cthe old animal\u201d) is of worse quality thanthe old animal,\n\t\t\t\tthe amount brought into account as a receipt under section 114 must not exceedthe equivalent amount for the new animal.\n\t\tIf, immediately before it was added to the herd, the new animal was part ofthe farmer\u2019s trading stock, \u201cthe equivalent amount for the new animal\u201d means\u2014\n\t\t\tin the case of an animal bred by the farmer, the cost of breeding theanimal and rearing it to maturity, and\n\t\t\tin any other case, the sum of the initial cost of acquiring the animal andthe cost (if any) incurred by the farmer in rearing the animal to maturity.\n\t\tOtherwise \u201cthe equivalent amount for the new animal\u201d means

or over a period not longer than 12 months, asubstantial part of the herd is sold, and\n\t\t\tthe farmer acquires or starts to acquire animals to replace the part soldwithin 5 years of the sale.\n\t\tSection 114 (replacement of animals in herd) applies so far as the animalsincluded in the part sold are replaced (but see section 121 (sale for reasonsoutside farmer\u2019s

made from post-cessationreceipts charged for an earlier accounting period in preference to thosecharged for a later accounting period.\n\t\t\tBut this does not authorise the deduction of a loss from post-cessationreceipts charged for an accounting period before the accounting period inwhich the loss is made.\n\tElection to carry back\n\t\tElection to carry back\n\t\t\tThis section applies if a post-cessation receipt is received by a companyin an accounting period beginning not later than 6 years after the companypermanently ceased to carry on the trade.\n\t\t\tThe company may elect that the tax chargeable in respect of the receipt isto be charged as if the receipt had been received on the date of the cessation(but see sections 199 and 200).\n\t\t\tThe election must be made before the end of the period of two yearsbeginning immediately after the end of the accounting period in which thereceipt is received.\n\t\tDeductions already made are not displaced\n\t\t\tThis section applies

section 197(2)) requires or permits adeduction in respect of that loss to be allowed, as a result of the election,for the accounting period in which the cessation occurred instead of theaccounting period for which the deduction has already been made.\n\t\t\tBut if the deduction was made for the accounting period in which thecarried back receipt was received, subsection (2) applies to the loss only sofar as it has been deducted from post-cessation receipts other than thecarried back receipt.\n\t\tElection given effect in accounting period in which receipt isreceived\n\t\t\tIf a company makes an election under section 198, the additional tax ispayable for the accounting period in which the receipt is received (and notfor the accounting period in which the cessation occurred).\n\t\t\tIn subsection (1) \u201cthe additional tax\u201d means an amount of tax equal to thedifference between\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe amount of tax that is chargeable on the company for the accountingperiod in which the cessation occurred (\u201camount A\u201d), and\n\t\t\t\tthe amount of tax that would have been chargeable on the company for thatperiod if the election had not been made (\u201camount B\u201d).\n\t\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tthe company has made, under section 198, one or more other elections forreceipts to be treated as received in the period in which the

the light of section 229(5) (reduction not toexceed amount being reduced).\n\t\tThe basic relieving amount by reference to a taxed receipt is given by

\n\t\t\t  * LRP is the receipt period of the receipt under calculation, and \n\t\t\t  * TRP is the receipt period of the taxed receipt. \n\t\tBut the basic relieving amount is different if section

effective durationof the lease,\n\t\t\tin the case of a receipt under section 219, the period in relation to whichthe sum payable instead of rent is payable,\n\t\t\tin the case of a receipt under section 221, the period for which thevariation or waiver has effect,\n\t\t\tin the case of a receipt under section 222, the effective duration of thelease remaining at the date of the assignment,

288(6) of that Act).\n\tThe additional calculation rule: special cases\n\t\tThis section explains how section 228 operates in some special cases.\n\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\tthe receipt under calculation is under any of sections 217 to 221, and\n\t\t\tthe lease does not extend to the whole of the premises subject to the taxedlease,\n\t\t\t\tthe basic relieving amount by reference to a taxed receipt is calculated bymultiplying the amount given by the formula in subsection (4) of section 228by the fraction of those premises which is subject to the lease.\n\t\tThis fraction is calculated on a just and reasonable basis.\n\t\tIf the basic relieving amount given by section 228(4) or subsection (2)above by reference to a taxed receipt would otherwise exceed the unused amountof the taxed receipt, the basic relieving amount is the unused amount.\n\t\tIf the amount of the reduction under section 228 would otherwise exceed theamount given, in respect of the receipt under calculation, by the formula insection 217, 219, 220, 221 or 222, the amount of the reduction is equal to theamount given by the formula.\n\tMeaning of \u201cunused amount\u201d and \u201cunreduced amount\u201d\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Chapter, a taxed receipt has an \u201cunused amount\u201d ifthe unreduced amount exceeds the total of the reductions and deductionsreferred to in subsection (5).\n\t\tIn this Chapter the \u201cunreduced amount\u201d of a taxed receipt is the amountgiven, in respect of the taxed receipt, by the formula in\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 217, 219, 220, 221 or 222 above, or\n\t\t\tsection 277, 279, 280, 281 or 282 of ITTOIA 2005 (income tax provisionscorresponding to those listed in paragraph (a)).\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies\u2014\n\t\t\tto a taxed receipt under section 217 (lease premiums) as a result ofsection 218 (amount treated as lease premium where work required), and\n\t\t\tto a taxed receipt under section 277 of ITTOIA 2005 (lease premiums) as aresult of section 278 of that Act (amount treated as lease premium where workrequired).\n\t\tIf the obligation to carry out work included the carrying out of work whichgives, or will give, rise to qualifying expenditure under CAA 2001, theunreduced amount of the taxed receipt is calculated as if the obligation hadnot included the carrying out of that work.\n\t\tThe reductions and deductions mentioned in subsection (1) are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe reductions under section 228 above or section 288 of ITTOIA 2005 (theadditional calculation rule) by reference to the taxed receipt,\n\t\t\tthe deductions made in calculating the

which section 336 has applied where the company replacing anotheras a party to a loan relationship later leaves the group of companies of whichthey were members.\n\t\tSection 347 (disapplication of Chapter where transferor party to avoidanceinvolving subsequent transfer by transferee) disapplies this Chapter in somecircumstances in the cases mentioned in 336 and 337.\n\t\tFor the meaning of references in this Chapter to a company replacinganother as a party to a loan relationship, see section 338.\n\t\tIn this Chapter references to a company being a member of a group ofcompanies are to be read in accordance with section 170 of TCGA 1992(interpretation of sections 171 to 181 of that Act: groups).\n\tTransfers of loans on group transactions\n\t\tThe case referred to in section 335(1)(a) is where\u2014\n\t\t\tthere is a transaction within subsection (2) or a series of transactionswithin subsection (3), and\n\t\t\tas a result one of the companies involved (\u201cthe transferee\u201d) directly orindirectly replaces the other (\u201cthe transferor\u201d) as a party to a loanrelationship.\n\t\tA transaction is within this subsection if it is a related transactionbetween two companies which are\u2014\n\t\t\tmembers of the same group, and\n\t\t\twithin the charge to corporation tax in respect of that transaction.\n\t\tA series of transactions is within this subsection if it is a series havingthe same effect as a related transaction between two companies each of which\u2014\n\t\t\thas been a member of the same group at any time in the course of thatseries, and\n\t\t\twould be within the charge to corporation tax in respect of such a relatedtransaction.\n\t\tThis Chapter does not apply as a result of this section in relation to\u2014\n\t\t\ta transfer of an asset, or\n\t\t\ta transfer of rights under, or an interest in, an asset,\n\t\t\t\tas a result of a transaction within subsection (2) or a series of transactionswithin subsection (3) if immediately before or after the transfer the asset iswithin one of the categories set out in section 440(4)(a), (d) and (e) of ICTA(assets held for certain categories of long-term business).\n\t\tIn this Chapter, in relation to a case within subsection (1), \u201cthetransferee\u201d and \u201cthe transferor\u201d have the same meaning as in that subsection.\n\tTransfers of loans on insurance business transfers\n\t\tThe case referred to in section 335(1)(b) is where\u2014\n\t\t\ta transfer between two companies occurs to which this section applies, and\n\t\t\tas a result one of the companies (\u201cthe transferee\u201d) directly or indirectlyreplaces the other (\u201cthe transferor\u201d) as a party to a loan relationship.\n\t\tThis section applies to the transfers specified in subsection (3), so faras they are not excluded by subsection (4).\n\t\tThey are\u2014\n\t\t\ta transfer between two companies of business consisting of the effecting orcarrying out of contracts of long-term insurance which has effect under aninsurance business transfer scheme, and\n\t\t\tany transfer between two companies which is a qualifying overseas transfer.\n\t\tSubsection (3) does not apply to a transfer of an asset, or of rights underor an interest in an asset, if the asset\u2014\n\t\t\twas within one of the categories set out in section 440(4) of ICTAimmediately before the transfer, and\n\t\t\tis not within that category immediately after it.\n\t\tSubsection (6) applies for the purposes of subsection (4) if one of thecompanies mentioned in subsection (3) is an overseas life insurance company.\n\t\tAn asset is taken as being in the same category both immediately before andimmediately after a transfer if the asset\u2014\n\t\t\twas in one category immediately before the transfer, and\n\t\t\tis within the corresponding category immediately after it.\n\t\tIn this Chapter, in relation to a case within subsection (1), \u201cthetransferee\u201d and \u201cthe

tothose of B under a loan relationship to which B has previously ceased to be aparty.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (2), A\u2019s rights under a creditorrelationship are equivalent to rights under another creditor relationship ifeach set of rights gives the holder of an asset representing the relationshipin question\u2014\n\t\t\tthe same rights against the same persons as to capital,

representing each relationship,\n\t\t\tthe form in which they are held, or\n\t\t\tthe way in which they can be transferred,\n\t\t\t\tis ignored.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (2), A\u2019s obligations under a debtorrelationship are equivalent to obligations under another debtor relationshipif each set of obligations subjects the holder of the liability representingthe relationship in question to\u2014\n\t\t\tthe same obligations to the same persons as to capital, interest anddividends, and\n\t\t\tthe same remedies to enforce those obligations.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (5), any difference in\u2014\n\t\t\tthe total nominal amounts of the assets representing the creditorrelationship corresponding to each relationship,\n\t\t\tthe form in which those assets are held,

of conditions A toD is met.\n\t\tCondition A is that sections 127 to 130 of TCGA 1992 (reorganisations:equation of original shares and new holding)\u2014\n\t\t\tapply in relation to an exchange as a result of section 135(3) of that Act(which provides for sections 127 to 130 to apply to an exchange of securitiesfor those in another company as if it were a reorganisation), or\n\t\t\twould so apply but for section 116(5) of that Act (which disappliessections 127 to 130 where the original shares or the new holding consist of orinclude a qualifying corporate bond).\n\t\tCondition B is that the original shares consist of or include an assetrepresenting a loan relationship.\n\t\tCondition C is that company A is resident in one member State and company Bis resident in another member State.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section a company is resident in a member Stateif\u2014\n\t\t\tit is within a charge to tax under the law of the State as being residentfor that purpose, and\n\t\t\tit is not regarded, for the purpose of any double taxation reliefarrangements to which the State is a party, as resident in a territory notwithin a member State.\n\t\tCondition D is that neither Chapter 13 (European cross-border transfers ofbusiness) nor Chapter 14 (European cross-border mergers) applies in relationto the exchange.\n\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\u201ccompany A\u201d and \u201ccompany B\u201d have the same meaning as in section 135 of TCGA1992,\n\t\t\t\u201coriginal shares\u201d has the same meaning as it has for the purposes ofsections 126 to 131 of that

(which treat debt releases as occurring when impaireddebts become held by companies which might otherwise benefit from theexclusion under section 358).\n\t\t\tIn this Chapter \u201crelease debit\u201d means a debit in respect of a release by acompany of liability under a creditor relationship of the company.\n\t\t\tSection 466 (companies connected for an accounting period) applies for thepurposes

the amountwhich would be the carrying value of the liability under the loan relationshipin D\u2019s accounts if a period of account had ended immediately before C became aparty to it.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (5) the carrying value is determined takingno account of\u2014\n\t\t\t\taccrued amounts, or\n\t\t\t\tamounts paid or received in advance.\n\t\tParties becoming connected where

consortium company is owned, or\n\t\t\ta company (a \u201cgroup member\u201d) which is a member of the same group ofcompanies as the member company but is not itself a member of the consortium,and\n\t\t\tthe consortium company or, if that company is a holding company, aconsortium company which is a subsidiary of that company is (or was) thedebtor (the \u201cdebtor consortium company\u201d).\n\t\tThe provisions of this Chapter\u2014\n\t\t\treduce debits for impairment losses and release debits under relevantconsortium creditor relationships where an amount surrendered as group reliefby the consortium company is claimed by a member company or group member (seesection 365),\n\t\t\tprovide for a corresponding reduction in credits in respect of suchrelationships where a reduction within paragraph (a) has occurred (see section367),\n\t\t\treduce claims for group relief where debits within paragraph (a) forearlier group accounting periods exceed reductions within paragraph (b) (seesection 368), and\n\t\t\tprovide for such claims to be carried forward where they exceed such debits(see section 369).\n\t\tIn this Chapter \u201crelease debit\u201d means a debit in respect of a release ofliability under a relevant consortium creditor relationship.\n\t\tIf section 403C of ICTA (amount of relief in consortium cases) applies,effect must be given to that section before effect is given to this Chapter.\n\t\tExpressions defined in this section have the same meaning in the otherprovisions of this Chapter, and sections 370 and 371 also apply for theinterpretation of this Chapter.\n\t\tFor the meaning of \u201cimpairment loss\u201d see section 476(1).\n\tReduction of impairment loss debits where group relief claimed\n\t\tThis section applies for any group accounting period for which there is anet consortium debit.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Chapter there is a net consortium debit for agroup accounting period if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe total of the impairment losses and release debits brought into accountfor that period in respect of relevant consortium creditor relationships by\u2014\n\t\t\tthe member company, and\n\t\t\tevery group member,\n\t\t\t\texceeds\n\t\t\tthe total credits so brought into account by them in connection with debtsowed by the companies which are the debtor consortium companies in respect ofthose relationships.\n\t\tThe net consortium debit is equal to that excess.\n\t\tIf there is a claim for that group accounting period by the member companyor a group member for group relief in respect of an amount which may besurrendered as group relief by the debtor consortium companies, the debitsbrought into account in respect of the impairment losses and the releasedebits mentioned in subsection (2)(a) are reduced.\n\t\tThe amount of reduction in the case of each of the debits referred to insubsection (4) (\u201cthe relevant debits\u201d) is calculated as follows.\n\t\t\t  * _Step 1_\n\t\tFind the total amount which\u2014\n\t\t\tmay be surrendered as group relief by the debtor consortium companies, and\n\t\t\tis claimed as group relief for the group accounting period by the membercompany or any group member.\n\t\t\t\t  * _Step 2_\n\t\t\tIf the amount found at Step 1 does not exceed the net consortium debit,apportion the amount found at Step 1 between the relevant debits in proportionto their respective amounts.\n\t\t\tIf the amount found at Step 1 exceeds the net consortium debit, apportion somuch of the amount found at Step 1 as does not exceed it between the relevantdebits in proportion to their respective amounts.\n\t\tThis section is subject to section 366.\n\tEffect where credit for release brought into account on amortised costbasis\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\ta company releases liability under a relevant consortium creditorrelationship of the company (\u201cthe release amount\u201d), and\n\t\t\tthe debtor consortium company brings into account an amount in respect ofthe release for any accounting period in accordance with an amortised costbasis of accounting.\n\t\tAn amount equal to the release amount is treated for the purposes of thisChapter as not being a debit brought into account for that period in relationto the relevant consortium creditor relationship.\n\tReduction of credits exceeding impairment losses\n\t\tThis section applies if, apart from this section, for any group accountingperiod\u2014\n\t\t\tthe total of the impairment losses and release debits brought into accountfor that period in respect of relevant consortium creditor relationships by\u2014\n\t\t\tthe member company, and\n\t\t\tevery group member,\n\t\t\t\tis less than\n\t\t\tthe total credits so brought into account by them in connection with debtsowed by the companies which are the debtor consortium companies in respect ofthose relationships.\n\t\tThose credits are reduced (but not below nil) in accordance with subsection(3).\n\t\tThe amount of reduction in the case of each credit is calculated asfollows.\n\t\t\t  * _Step 1_\n\t\tFind the total amount by which the debits in respect of the relationships forprevious group accounting periods have been reduced under section 365(4).\n\t\t\t  * _Step 2_\n\t\tDeduct the total amount by which credits have previously been reduced underthis section from the amount found at Step 1.\n\t\t\t  * _Step 3_\n\t\tApportion the amount found at Step 2 between the credits in proportion totheir respective amounts.\n\tReduction of claims where there are earlier net consortium debits\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\tfor any group accounting period there is a claim by the member company or agroup member for group relief in respect of an amount which may be surrenderedas group relief by debtor consortium companies, and\n\t\t\tthe total amount of the net consortium debits for earlier group accountingperiods in respect of the relevant consortium creditor relationships exceedsany reductions in respect of those debits falling to be made under section365(4).\n\t\tIn this section that excess is referred to as \u201cthe unreduced debitsamount\u201d.\n\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\tthe claim is the only claim for that period, and\n\t\t\tit exceeds the unreduced debits amount,\n\t\t\t\tthe claim is reduced by the unreduced debits amount.\n\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\tthe claim is not the only claim for that period, and\n\t\t\tthe total of the claims exceeds the unreduced debits amount,\n\t\t\tthe claim is reduced by the same proportion of the unreduced debits amount asthe claim bears to that total.\n\t\tIn any other case, the claim is reduced to nil.\n\tCarry forward of claims where there are no net consortium debits\n\t\tThis section applies if for any group accounting period there is\u2014\n\t\t\ta claim by the member company or a group member for group relief in respectof an amount which may be surrendered as group relief by debtor consortiumcompanies (as reduced under section 368, if it applies), and\n\t\t\tno net consortium debit in respect of the relevant consortium creditorrelationships.\n\t\tThe claim (as so reduced) is carried forward and treated for the purposesof section 365\u2014\n\t\t\tas increasing any such claim for group relief made by the claimant companyfor its next accounting period, or\n\t\t\tif apart from this subsection there would be no such claim, as being such aclaim.\n\tGroup accounting periods\n\t\tIn this Chapter \u201cgroup accounting period\u201d means\u2014\n\t\t\tany accounting period of the member company beginning on or after 1 October2002, or\n\t\t\tany accounting period of a group member which\u2014\n\t\t\tbegins on or after that date, and\n\t\t\tcorresponds to such an accounting period of the member company.\n\t\tAny such accounting period of the member company and any such correspondingaccounting periods of group members are treated for the purposes of thisChapter as being the same accounting period.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Chapter an accounting period of a group membercorresponds to an accounting period of the member company if condition A, B orC is met.\n\t\tCondition A is that the periods coincide.\n\t\tCondition B is that the accounting period of the member company includesmore than half of the accounting period of the group member.\n\t\tCondition C is that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe accounting period of the member company includes part of the accountingperiod of the group member, and\n\t\t\tthe remainder of that period is not within any accounting period of themember company.\n\tInterpretation \n\t\tIn this Chapter\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cconsortium company\u201d means a company within

that the condition in paragraph (b) is met, and\n\t\t\tD is a small or medium-sized enterprise for the actual accrual period.\n\t\tSection 376 applies for the interpretation of this section.\n\tInterpretation of section 375\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 375 and this section, section 414 of ICTA(meaning of \u201cclose company\u201d in the Tax Acts) applies with the omission ofsection 414(1)(a) (exclusion of non-UK resident companies).\n\t\tA person who is a participator in a company which controls another companyis treated for the purposes of section 375 and this section

credits and debits into accountunder this Part in relation to the debt or relationship for each of itsaccounting periods in which the conditions in subsection (1) are met.\n\t\tThe following provisions of this Chapter contain special rules about thecredits and debits to be brought into account under subsection (3)\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 381 (determinations of credits and debits by company

and losses), and\n\t\t\tsection 385 (company partners' shares where firm owns deeply discountedsecurities).\n\t\tIn those provisions \u201ccompany partner\u201d has the same meaning as in thissection.\n\tDeterminations of credits and debits by company partners: general\n\t\tThe credits and debits to be brought into account under section 380(3) areto be determined separately for each company partner as follows.\n\t\tThe money debt owed by or to the firm is treated as if\u2014\n\t\t\tit were owed by or, as the case may be, to the company partner, and\n\t\t\tit were so owed for the purposes of the trade or business which the companypartner carries on.\n\t\tIf the money debt arises from a transaction for the lending of money\u2014\n\t\t\tit continues to be treated as so arising, and\n\t\t\taccordingly the company partner is treated as having a loan relationship.\n\t\tAnything done by or in relation to the firm in connection with the moneydebt is treated as done by or in relation to the company partner.\n\t\tThe credits and debits in the case of each company partner are thepartner\u2019s appropriate share of the total credits and debits determined inaccordance with subsections (2) to (4) (without any reduction for the factthat the debt is treated as owed by or to each company partner).\n\t\tA company partner\u2019s \u201cappropriate share\u201d is the share that would beapportioned to it on the assumption in subsection (7).\n\t\tThe assumption is that the total credits and debits determined inaccordance with subsections (2) to (4) are apportioned between the partners inthe shares in which any profit or loss would be apportioned between them inaccordance with the firm\u2019s profit-sharing arrangements.\n\tCompany partners using fair value accounting\n\t\tThis section applies if a company partner uses fair value accounting inrelation to its interest in the firm.\n\t\tThe credits and debits to be brought into account by the company partnerunder section 380(3) are to be determined on the basis of fair valueaccounting.\n\tLending between partners and the partnership\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe money debt owed by or to the firm arises from a transaction for thelending of money, and\n\t\t\tthere is a time in an accounting period of a company partner (\u201cthe relevantaccounting period\u201d) when conditions A, B and C are met.\n\t\tCondition A is that\u2014\n\t\t\tif the debt is owed by the firm, the company partner stands in the positionof a creditor and accordingly has a creditor relationship, and\n\t\t\tif the debt is owed to the firm, the company partner stands in the positionof a debtor and accordingly has a debtor relationship.\n\t\tCondition B is that the company partner controls the firm either alone ortaken together with one or more other company partners connected with thecompany partner (see subsection (7)).\n\t\tCondition C is that the company partner or any other company partner istreated under section 381(3) as if\u2014\n\t\t\tit had the debtor relationship which corresponds to the creditorrelationship mentioned in subsection (2)(a), or\n\t\t\tit had the creditor relationship which corresponds to the debtorrelationship mentioned in subsection (2)(b).\n\t\tIf this section applies, for the purposes of this Part for the relevantaccounting period there is taken to be a connection between\u2014\n\t\t\tthe company partner, and\n\t\t\teach company partner that is within subsection (4) (including the companypartner itself if it is within that subsection),\n\t\t\t\tas a result of one of them having control of the other at a time in the periodfor the purposes of section 466(2).\n\t\tThe provisions of this Part about connected companies relationships applyaccordingly.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (3), one company partner is connected withanother at any time in an accounting period if at that or any other time inthe accounting

a result ofsection 328(1), or that section is disapplied by section 328(3), depends onthe firm\u2019s accounts.\n\t\tSection 328(3) applies only so far as exchange gains and losses arerecognised in the firm\u2019s statement of total recognised gains and losses,statement of recognised income and expense, statement of changes in equity orstatement of income and retained earnings.\n\t\tAccordingly, a company partner must bring credits and debits into accountunder this Chapter in respect of exchange gains and losses which are not sorecognised.\n\t\tFor the meaning of references in this section to exchange gains and losses,see section 475.\n\tCompany partners' shares where firm owns deeply discounted securities\n\t\tThis section applies if the firm holds a deeply discounted security.\n\t\tEach

where relevant debts prevented from being deductible as expensesof insurance companies at Step 1 of section 76(7) of ICTA).\n\t\t\tIn this Chapter \u201cBLAGAB\u201d means basic life assurance and general annuitybusiness.\n\tTreatment of deficit on basic life assurance and general annuity business\n\t\tTreatment of deficit on basic life assurance and general annuitybusiness: introduction\n\t\t\tSections 388 to 391 apply instead of Chapter 16 (non-trading deficits) if acompany has a non-trading deficit from its loan relationships for BLAGAB forany accounting period.\n\t\t\tIn those sections \u201cthe deficit\u201d and \u201cthe deficit period\u201d mean that deficitand that period respectively.\n\t\tBasic rule: deficit set off against income and gains of deficitperiod\n\t\t\tThe basic rule is that the deficit must be set off against any income andgains of the deficit period which are referable to BLAGAB.\n\t\t\tThe income and gains are reduced accordingly.\n\t\t\tAny such reduction is made before any expenses deduction under section 76of ICTA (expenses of insurance companies).\n\t\tClaim to carry back deficit\n\t\t\tIf the deficit exceeds the income and gains for the deficit period referredto in section 388(1), the company may make a claim for the whole or part ofthe excess (\u201cthe claim amount\u201d)\u2014\n\t\t\t\tto be carried back for up to 3 accounting periods ending within thepermitted period, and\n\t\t\t\tto be set off against the available profits of the company in those periodsin accordance with subsection (2).\n\t\t\tThe claim amount reduces the company\u2019s available profits in the most recentaccounting period of the company, before any remainder reduces those in thenext most recent accounting period and then those in the next most recentaccounting period.\n\t\t\tFor the meaning of \u201cavailable profits\u201d, see section 390.\n\t\t\tIn this section and that section \u201cpermitted period\u201d means the period of 12months immediately before the deficit period.\n\t\t\tA claim under this section must be made\u2014\n\t\t\t\twithin the period of 2 years after the end of the deficit period, or\n\t\t\t\twithin such further period as an officer of Revenue and Customs allows.\n\t\tMeaning of \u201cavailable profits\u201d\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of section 389 the available profits of the company for anaccounting period are its BLAGAB non-trading loan relationships profits forthe period (see subsection (4)), less the unused part of the relevantdeductions for the period (see subsection (5)).\n\t\t\tIf an accounting period ending within the permitted period begins beforeit, only a part of the amount which would otherwise be the available profitfor that accounting period is available profit.\n\t\t\tThat part is so much as is proportionate to the part of the accountingperiod in the permitted period.\n\t\t\tReferences in this section to a company\u2019s BLAGAB non-trading loanrelationships profits for an accounting period are references to the amount(if any) which is chargeable to tax for that period under section 299 (chargeto tax on non-trading profits) for the company\u2019s BLAGAB.\n\t\t\tThe unused part of the relevant deductions for an accounting period isfound as follows.\n\t\t\t\t  * _Step 1_\n\t\t\t\tAdd together\u2014\n\t\t\t\tso much of the expenses deduction for the period given by Step 8 in section76(7) of ICTA (expenses of insurance companies) as is referable to BLAGAB, and\n\t\t\t\tso much of the sum of the deductions made in the case of the company inrespect of charges on income for that period as is so referable.\n\t\t\t\t\t  * _Step 2_\n\t\t\t\tAdd together\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe total amounts so referable which could be applied for the period in makingdeductions as a result of section 76 of ICTA if the company\u2019s BLAGAB non-trading loan relationships profits for the period were disregarded, and\n\t\t\t\tthe total amounts so referable which could be applied for the period in makingdeductions in respect of charges on income if those profits were disregarded.\n\t\t\t\t\t  * _Step 3_\n\t\t\t\tSubtract the amount found at Step 2 from the amount found at Step 1.\n\t\t\t\tThe result is the unused part of the relevant deductions for the accountingperiod.\n\t\t\tIn the case of any claim under section 389, the reference in Step 1(a) insubsection (5) to the expenses deduction for an accounting period given byStep 8 in section 76(7) of ICTA and the reference in Step 2(a) in subsection(5) to the deduction for expenses as a result of section 76 of ICTA for anaccounting period are references to the deduction for expenses that would havebeen made as a result of that section for that period on the assumptions insubsections (7) and (8).\n\t\t\tThe first assumption is that no account is taken of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat claim, or\n\t\t\t\tany other claim under section 389 relating to a deficit for an accountingperiod after the deficit period.\n\t\t\tThe second assumption is that all such adjustments are made as are requiredas a result of any sum having been carried back under the Corporation Tax Actsto the accounting period mentioned in subsection (5), otherwise than as aresult of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe claim mentioned in subsection (6), or\n\t\t\t\tany such other claim as is mentioned in subsection (7)(b).\n\t\tCarry forward of surplus deficit to next accounting period\n\t\t\tThis rule applies if any of the deficit is not\u2014\n\t\t\t\tset off against the income and gains referred to in section 388(1), or\n\t\t\t\tset off against the profits referred to in section 389(1) as the result ofa claim under that section.\n\t\t\tThat deficit must be carried forward to the accounting period immediatelyafter the deficit period (\u201cthe next period\u201d).\n\t\t\tAny deficit so carried forward is treated for the purposes of theCorporation Tax Acts (including sections 388 to 390) as expenses payablewhich\u2014\n\t\t\t\tare referable to the next period, and\n\t\t\t\tare to be brought into account at Step 3 in section 76(7) of ICTA (expensesof insurance companies).\n\tExclusion of loan relationships of members of Lloyd's\n\t\tExclusion of loan relationships of members of Lloyd's\n\t\t\tThis section applies to any loan relationship of a corporate member ofLloyd's.\n\t\t\tThis Part does not apply as respects the relationship so far as rights orliabilities under it or securities representing it are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tassets forming part of the member\u2019s premium trust fund, or\n\t\t\t\tliabilities attached to that fund.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201ccorporate member\u201d and \u201cpremium trust fund\u201d have the samemeaning as in Chapter 5 of Part 4 of FA 1994 (Lloyd\u2019s underwriters:corporations etc) (see section 230(1) of that Act).\n\tDetermination of questions requiring apportionments\n\t\tGeneral rules for some debtor relationships\n\t\t\tThis section applies if a debtor relationship of an insurance company isrepresented by a liability which is a liability of its long-term insurancefund.\n\t\t\tAny question arising for the purposes of the Corporation Tax Acts as to howfar any credits or debits given for the purposes of this Part in respect ofthe liability are referable to any particular category of the company\u2019s long-term business is determined as follows.\n\t\t\tIn the case of credits and debits within the rules in section 394, thatsection applies.\n\t\t\tIn the case of other credits and debits, the relevant fraction of thecredits or debits is referable to a category of long-term business.\n\t\t\tThat fraction is determined by applying section 432A(6) to (6B) and (8) ofICTA (apportionment of income and gains) as if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe credits or debits were income not directly referable to any category ofbusiness, and\n\t\t\t\tthe references in section 432A(6) to assets directly referable to acategory of business were references to assets linked to that category.\n\t\tSpecial rules for some debtor relationships\n\t\t\tThis section sets out the rules referred to in section 393(3) as to how farcertain credits or debits given for the purposes of this Part in respect ofliabilities representing a debtor relationship of an insurance company whichare liabilities of its long-term insurance fund are referable to anyparticular category of its long-term business.\n\t\t\tIf the liabilities are liabilities of an internal linked fund of thecompany relating to one category of long-term business, the credits or debitsare referable to that category.\n\t\t\tIf the liabilities are liabilities of an internal linked fund of thecompany relating to two or more such categories, the credits or debits arereferable to those categories in the same proportions as the linked assets inthe fund are apportioned to them under section 432ZA(4) of ICTA (linkedassets).\n\t\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tthe liabilities arise from deposit back arrangements, and\n\t\t\t\tthe business reinsured by the arrangements under which the deposit backarrangements are made (\u201cthe reinsurance arrangements\u201d) is within one categoryof long term business,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe credits or debits are referable to that category.\n\t\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tthe liabilities arise from deposit back arrangements, and\n\t\t\t\tthe business reinsured by the reinsurance arrangements is within two ormore such categories,\n\t\t\t\tthe credits or debits are referable to those categories in the sameproportions as the relevant proportions of the liabilities reinsured by thearrangements which are liabilities relating to those categories.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (5) \u201crelevant proportion\u201d, in relation toreinsured liabilities of any particular category of business, means theaverage of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe proportion of all the reinsured liabilities that are liabilitiesrelating to that category at the beginning of the period of account, and\n\t\t\t\tthe proportion of all the reinsured liabilities that are liabilitiesrelating to that category at the end of that period.\n\t\t\tDebits relating to interest payable in respect of the late payment of anybenefits are referable to the category of long-term business that comprisesthe effecting and carrying out of the policies or contracts under which thebenefits are payable."

that change is an increase, the carrying value of the security at theearlier time is increased by the same percentage as the percentage increase inthe retail prices index between those times.\n\t\tIf that change is a reduction, the carrying value of the security at theearlier time is reduced by the same percentage as the percentage reduction inthe retail prices index between those times.\n\t\tThe Treasury may, in relation to any description of index-linked gilt-edgedsecurities, by order provide that\u2014\n\t\t\tthere are to be no adjustments under this section, or\n\t\t\tan adjustment specified in the order is to be made instead.\n\t\tAn order under subsection (4)\u2014\n\t\t\tmay not apply to a security issued before the making of the order, but\n\t\t\tmay make different provision for different descriptions of securities.\n\t\tThe general rule is that the percentage increase or reduction in the retailprices index is determined for the purposes of this section by reference tothe difference between\u2014\n\t\t\tthe index for the month in which the earlier time falls, and\n\t\t\tthe index for the month in which the later time falls.\n\t\tBut if the earlier time falls at the

instead of section 422 if, in a case where thatsection would otherwise apply, the transferor is regarded for the purposes ofthis section as using fair value accounting in respect of the

this section as using fairvalue accounting in respect of the loan relationship only if the credits anddebits to be brought into account for the purposes of this Part as respectsthe relationship are determined on that basis.\n\t\t\tIt does not matter for the purposes of subsection (4) if the transferordoes not otherwise use fair value accounting in respect of the loanrelationship.\n\t\tReorganisations involving loan relationships\n\t\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsections 127 to 130 of TCGA 1992 (reorganisations: equation of originalshares and new

representing the loan relationship for consideration ofan amount equal to its notional carrying value.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of this section, the notional carrying value of that assetis the amount which would have been its carrying value in the accounts of theoriginal holder if a period of account had ended immediately before the datewhen the reorganisation occurred.\n\t\t\tIn this

Act), and \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201creorganisation\u201d includes anything to which sections 127 to 130 of that Act apply as if it were a reorganisation. \n\t\t\tThis section is subject

value accounting\n\t\t\tThis section applies instead of section 424 if, in a case where thatsection would otherwise apply, the original holder is regarded for thepurposes of this section as using fair value accounting in respect of the loanrelationship constituting or included in the original shares.\n\t\t\tThe amount which is to be brought into account by the original holder inrespect of the reorganisation (\u201cthe disposal amount\u201d) is the fair value of theasset representing the loan relationship as at the date when thereorganisation occurred, or of the rights under or interest in thatrelationship as at that date.\n\t\t\tFor any accounting period in which a successor creditor company is a partyto the loan relationship, for the purpose of determining the credits anddebits to be brought into account in respect of the relationship for thepurposes of this Part, the successor creditor company is treated as if it hadacquired the asset representing the loan relationship for consideration of anamount equal to the disposal amount.\n\t\t\tSubsections (4) and (5) of section 423 apply for the purposes of thissection as they apply for the purposes of that section, but taking thereferences in that section to the transferor as references to the originalholder.\n\t\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201csuccessor creditor company\u201d means a company in relation to which the loan relationship constituting or included in the original shares is a creditor relationship immediately after the reorganisation, and \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201coriginal holder\u201d and \u201coriginal shares\u201d have the same meaning as in section 424. \n\t\t\tThis section is subject to section 429 (disapplication of Chapter wheretransparent entities involved).\n\tException for tax

merger\u201d and \u201cthe merging companies\u201d have the samemeaning as in this section.\n\t\t\tSee\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tsection 432 for the meaning of \u201cthe transferee\u201d and \u201ctransferor\u201d, and\n\t\t\t\tsection 439 for the meaning of \u201ccompany\u201d, \u201cco-operative society\u201d and\u201cresident in a member State\u201d.\n\t\tMeaning of \u201cthe transferee\u201d and \u201ctransferor\u201d\n\t\t\tIn this Chapter, \u201cthe transferee\u201d means\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin relation to a merger within section 431(3)(a), the SE,\n\t\t\t\tin relation to a merger within section 431(3)(b), the SCE, and\n\t\t\t\tin relation to a merger within section 431(3)(c) or (d), the company towhich assets and liabilities are transferred.\n\t\t\tIn this Chapter

societymerging to form the SCE, and\n\t\t\t\tin relation to a merger within section 431(3)(c) or (d), a companytransferring all its assets and liabilities.\n\tTransfers of loan relationships at notional carrying value\n\t\tTransfer of loan relationship at notional carrying value\n\t\t\tThis section applies if in the course of the merger a transferor transfersan asset or liability representing a loan relationship to the transferee.\n\t\t\tFor the purpose of determining the credits and debits to be brought intoaccount in respect of the loan relationship in accordance with this Part, thetransferor and the transferee are treated as having entered into the transferof that asset or liability for consideration of an amount equal to thenotional carrying value of the asset or liability.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\t\u201ccarrying value\u201d has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of section316 (see section 317), and\n\t\t\t\t\u201cnotional carrying value\u201d, in relation to an asset or liability, means theamount which would have been its carrying value in the accounts of thetransferor if a period of account had ended immediately before the date whenthe transferor ceased to be a party to the loan relationship.\n\t\t\tThis section is subject to section 434.\n\t\tTransferor using fair value accounting\n\t\t\tThis section applies instead of section 433 if, in a case where thatsection would otherwise apply, the transferor is regarded for the purposes ofthis section as using fair value accounting in respect of the loanrelationship (see subsection (4)).\n\t\t\tThe amount which is to be brought into account by the transferor in respectof the transfer of the asset or liability mentioned in section 433(1) (\u201cthetransferor\u2019s amount\u201d) is\u2014\n\t\t\t\tif an asset is to be brought into account, its fair value as at the datewhen the transferee becomes a party to the loan relationship, or the fairvalue of the rights under or interest in it as at that date, and\n\t\t\t\tif a liability is to be brought into account, its fair value as at thatdate.\n\t\t\tFor any accounting period in which the transferee is a party to the loanrelationship, for the purpose of determining the credits and debits to bebrought into account in respect of it for the purposes of this Part, thetransferee is treated as if it had acquired the asset or liabilityrepresenting the relationship for consideration of an amount equal to thetransferor\u2019s amount.\n\t\t\tThe transferor is regarded for the purposes of this section as using fairvalue accounting in respect of the loan relationship only if the credits anddebits to be brought into account for the purposes of this Part as respectsthe relationship are determined on that basis.\n\t\t\tIt does not matter for the purposes of subsection (4) if the transferordoes not otherwise use fair value accounting in respect of the loanrelationship.\n\t\tReorganisations involving loan relationships\n\t\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsections 127 to 130 of TCGA 1992 (reorganisations: equation of originalshares and new holding)\u2014\n\t\t\t\tapply in relation to a reorganisation, or\n\t\t\t\twould so apply but for section 116(5) of that Act (which disapplies thosesections where the original shares or the new holding consists of or includesa qualifying corporate bond),\n\t\t\t\tthe original shares consist of or include an asset representing a loanrelationship, and\n\t\t\t\tsection 433 or 434 applies in relation to a transfer in the course of themerger in which the reorganisation occurs or, in a case where those sectionswould apply apart from condition D in section 431 not being met, condition Gin that section is met in relation to such a transfer.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of this Part such debits and credits are to be broughtinto account as would be brought into account if the reorganisation were adisposal of the asset representing the loan relationship for consideration ofan amount equal to its notional carrying value.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of this section, the notional carrying value of that assetis the amount which would have been its carrying value in the accounts of theoriginal holder if a period of account had ended immediately before the datewhen the reorganisation occurred.\n\t\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201ccarrying value\u201d has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of section 316 (see section 317), \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201coriginal holder\u201d means a person holding the original shares immediately before the reorganisation, \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201coriginal shares\u201d has the meaning given by section 126(1) of TCGA 1992 (application of sections 126 to 131 of that Act), and \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201creorganisation\u201d includes anything to which sections 127 to 130 of that Act apply as if it were a reorganisation. \n\t\t\tThis section is subject to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 436 (original holder using fair value accounting), and\n\t\t\t\tsection 438 (disapplication of Chapter where transparent entitiesinvolved).\n\t\tOriginal holder using fair value accounting\n\t\t\tThis section applies instead of section 435 if, in a case where thatsection would otherwise apply, the original holder is regarded for thepurposes of this section as using fair value accounting in respect of the loanrelationship constituting or included in the original shares.\n\t\t\tThe amount which is to be brought into account by the original holder inrespect of the reorganisation (\u201cthe disposal amount\u201d) is the fair value of theasset representing the loan relationship as at the date when thereorganisation occurred, or of the rights under or interest in thatrelationship as at that date.\n\t\t\tFor any accounting period in which a successor creditor company is a partyto the loan relationship, for the purpose of determining the credits anddebits to be brought into account in respect of the relationship for thepurposes of this Part, the successor creditor company is treated as if it hadacquired the asset representing the loan relationship for consideration of anamount equal to the disposal amount.\n\t\t\tSubsections (4) and (5) of section 434 apply for the purposes of thissection as they apply for the purposes of that section, but taking thereferences in that section to the transferor as references to the originalholder.\n\t\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201csuccessor creditor company\u201d means a company in relation to which the loan relationship constituting or included in the original shares is a creditor relationship immediately after the reorganisation, and \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201coriginal holder\u201d and \u201coriginal shares\u201d have the same meaning as in section 435. \n\t\t\tThis section is subject to section 438 (disapplication of Chapter wheretransparent entities involved).\n\tException for tax avoidance cases\n\t\tTax avoidance etc\n\t\t\tThis Chapter does not apply in relation to the merger if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe merger is not effected for genuine commercial reasons, or\n\t\t\t\tthe merger forms part of a scheme or arrangements of which the mainpurpose, or one of the main purposes, is avoiding liability to corporationtax, capital gains tax or income tax.\n\t\t\tBut subsection (1) does not prevent this Chapter from applying if beforethe merger\u2014\n\t\t\t\tany of the merging companies has applied to the Commissioners for HerMajesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs, and\n\t\t\t\tthe Commissioners have notified the merging companies that they aresatisfied that subsection will not have that effect.\n\t\t\tSections 427 and 428 have effect in relation to subsection (2) as inrelation to section 426(2), taking the references in section 428 to section426(2)(b) as references to subsection (2)(b) of this section.\n\tTransparent entities\n\t\tDisapplication of Chapter where transparent entities involved\n\t\t\tThis section applies if one or more of the merging companies is atransparent entity.\n\t\t\tIf as a result of the merger the assets and liabilities of a transparententity are transferred to another company, this Chapter does not apply inrelation to the transfer.\n\t\t\tIf as a result of the merger the assets and liabilities of one or moreother companies are transferred to a transparent entity, sections 435 and 436do not apply to the new holding.\n\t\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cnew holding\u201d has the meaning given by section 126(1) of TCGA 1992 (application of sections 126 to 131 of that Act), and \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201ctransparent

section is subject to section 451 (exception to this section whereloan exceeds arm\u2019s length amount).\n\tMeaning of \u201ccorresponding debtor relationship\u201d\n\t\tIn section 449 \u201ccorresponding debtor relationship\u201d means a debtorrelationship which\u2014\n\t\t\tcorresponds to the creditor relationship mentioned in section 449(1), and\n\t\t\tis of such a kind that conditions A and B are met.\n\t\tCondition A is that such credits as are mentioned in subsection (3) wouldfall to be brought into account for the purposes of this Part in respect ofexchange gains from

creditor relationship apart from section 449.\n\t\tCondition B is that such debits as are mentioned in subsection (5) wouldfall to be so brought into account in respect of exchange losses from thatdebtor relationship.\n\t\tThose debits are debits corresponding to, and of the same amount as, thecredits that would fall to be so brought into account in respect of exchangegains from the creditor relationship apart from section 449.\n\t\tIn determining for the purposes of this section whether credits or debitswould fall to be so brought into account, section 328(2) to (7) (as a resultof which some exchange gains and losses are excluded from this Part) isignored.\n\tException to section 449 where loan exceeds arm\u2019s length amount\n\t\tSection 449 does not apply if the circumstances are such that, had theparties to the relevant transaction been dealing at arm\u2019s length, the amountof the loan would have been an amount (\u201cthe arm\u2019s length amount\u201d) greater thannil, but less than its actual amount.\n\t\tAccordingly, an exchange gain or loss which arises in the accounting periodin respect of an asset representing the creditor relationship is not

relationship,\n\t\t\t\tonly a proportion of the exchange gain or loss may be taken into account indetermining the credits or debits to be brought into account for the purposesof this Part.\n\t\tThat proportion is the proportion which the arm\u2019s length amount bears tothe actual amount of the loan.\n\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201ccorresponding debtor relationship\u201d has the same meaning as in section 449 (see section 450), and \n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe relevant transaction\u201d means the transaction giving rise to the loan as a result of which the company has the creditor relationship in the accounting period in question. \n\tExchange gains and losses where loan not on arm\u2019s length terms\n\t\tThis subsection applies if\u2014\n\t\t\ta company would be treated as having a debtor relationship in an accountingperiod if a claim were made under paragraph 6D(2) of Schedule 28AA to ICTA inrelation to that period, and\n\t\t\tfor that period there is a connection between that company and the companythat would have the corresponding creditor relationship.\n\t\tIf subsection (1) applies, it is assumed that such a claim is made for thepurpose of determining the debits or credits to be brought into account forthe purposes of this Part in respect of any exchange gains or losses arisingin that period in respect of the liability representing that

under section 301(6).\n\t\tIn this Chapter \u201cthe deficit\u201d and \u201cthe deficit period\u201d mean that deficitand that period respectively (but see section 458(5)).\n\t\tSections 457 and 458 set out the rules about carrying the deficit forwardto later accounting periods.\n\t\tSections 459 and 460 deal with claims for the deficit to be dealt withdifferently.\n\t\tSections 461 to 463 deal with the consequences of such claims.\n\tBasic rule for deficits: carry forward to accounting periods afterdeficit period\n\t\tThe basic rule is that the deficit must be carried forward and set offagainst non-trading profits of the company for accounting periods after thedeficit period in accordance with subsection (3) and section 458.\n\t\tThat rule does not apply to so much of the deficit as\u2014\n\t\t\tis surrendered as group relief under section 403 of ICTA, or\n\t\t\tis the subject of a claim by the company under section 459 (claim to setoff deficit against profits of deficit period or earlier periods).\n\t\tSo much of the amount carried forward from the deficit period as is not thesubject of a claim under section 458(1) must be set off against the non-trading profits of the company for the next accounting period after thedeficit period.\n\t\tThose profits are reduced accordingly.\n\t\tIn this Chapter \u201cnon-trading profits\u201d, in relation to a company, means somuch of the company\u2019s profits as does not consist of trading income for thepurposes of section 393A of ICTA (setting-off of trading losses againstprofits of the same or an earlier period).\n\tClaim to carry forward deficit to later accounting periods\n\t\tThe company may make a claim for so much of the amount carried forward fromthe deficit period as is specified in the claim to be excepted from being setoff against non-trading profits of the first accounting period after thedeficit period (\u201cthe first later period\u201d).\n\t\tAny such claim must be made within the period of 2 years after the end ofthe first later period.\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies if any amount is carried forward from the deficitperiod under section 457(1) which\u2014\n\t\t\tcannot be set off under section 457(3) against non-trading profits of thefirst later period, or\n\t\t\tis the subject of a claim under subsection (1).\n\t\tThat amount is treated for the purposes of this Part as if it were\u2014\n\t\t\tan amount of non-trading deficit from the company\u2019s loan relationships forthe first later period, and\n\t\t\tan amount which falls to be carried forward and set against non-tradingprofits of later accounting periods under section 457(1).\n\t\tAccordingly, section 457 and this section apply as if the first laterperiod were the deficit period.\n\tClaim to set off deficit against profits of deficit period or earlierperiods\n\t\tThe company may make a claim for the whole or part of the deficit\u2014\n\t\t\tto be set off against the total profits of the company for the deficitperiod, or\n\t\t\tto be carried back to be set off against profits for earlier accountingperiods.\n\t\tNo claim may be made under subsection (1) in respect of a deficit which issurrendered as group relief under section 403 of ICTA.\n\t\tSubsection (1) does not apply if the company is a charity.\n\t\tFor time limits and other provisions applicable to claims under subsection(1), see section 460.\n\t\tFor what happens when a claim is made under subsection (1)(a), see section461.\n\t\tFor what happens when a claim is made under subsection (1)(b), and for

within\u2014\n\t\t\tthe period of 2 years after the deficit period ends, or\n\t\t\tsuch further period as an officer of Revenue and Customs allows.\n\t\tDifferent claims may be made in respect of different parts of a non-tradingdeficit for any deficit period.\n\t\tBut no claim may be made in respect of any part of a deficit to whichanother such claim relates.\n\tClaim to set off deficit against other profits for the deficit period\n\t\tThis section applies if a claim is made under section 459(1)(a) for thewhole or part of the deficit to be set off against profits for the deficitperiod.\n\t\tThe general rule is that the amount to which the claim relates must be setoff against the profits of the company for the deficit period which areidentified in the claim.\n\t\tThose profits are reduced accordingly.\n\t\tThe general rule is subject to subsections (5) and (7).\n\t\tRelief for any deficit incurred in a trade in an earlier accounting periodmust be given before relief under this section.\n\t\tBut relief under this section must be given before relief is given againstprofits for the deficit period\u2014\n\t\t\tunder section 392A(1) or 393A(1) of ICTA (losses set against profits forthe same or earlier accounting periods), or\n\t\t\tas a result of a claim under section 459(1)(b) (carry-back) in respect of adeficit for a later period.\n\t\tNo relief may be given under this section against ring fence profits of thecompany within the meaning of Chapter 5 of Part 12 of ICTA (petroleumextraction activities).\n\tClaim to carry back deficit to earlier accounting periods\n\t\tThis section applies if a claim is made under 459(1)(b) for the whole orpart of the deficit to be carried back to be set off against profits foraccounting periods before the deficit period.\n\t\tThe claim has effect only if it relates to an amount equal to the lesserof\u2014\n\t\t\tso much of the deficit as is not an amount in relation to which a claim ismade under section 459(1)(a), and\n\t\t\tthe total amount of the profits available for relief under this section.\n\t\tSection 463 explains which profits are so available.\n\t\tThe amount to which the claim relates is set off against those profits bytreating them as reduced accordingly.\n\t\tIf those profits are profits for more than one accounting period, therelief is applied by setting off the amount to which the claim relates againstprofits for a later period before setting off any remainder of that amountagainst profits for an earlier period.\n\tProfits available for relief under section 462\n\t\tThe profits available for relief under section 462 are the amounts which(apart from the relief) would be charged under this Part as profits foraccounting periods ending within the permitted period, after giving everyprior relief.\n\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe permitted period\u201d means the period of 12 months immediately before the deficit period, and \n\t\t\t  * \u201cprior relief\u201d means a relief which subsection (5) provides must be given before relief under section 462. \n\t\tIf an accounting period ending within the permitted period begins beforeit, only a part of the amount which (apart from the relief) would bechargeable under this Part for that period, after giving every prior relief,is available for relief under section 462.\n\t\tThat part is so much as is

not include references tothe general partner of a limited partnership which is a collective investmentscheme.\n\tMeaning of \u201cmajor interest\u201d\n\t\tIn this Part references to a company (\u201cA\u201d) having a major interest inanother company (\u201cB\u201d) are to be read as follows.\n\t\tA has a major interest in B at any time if at that time\u2014\n\t\t\tA and one other person (\u201cC\u201d), taken together, have control of B, and\n\t\t\tA and C each have interests, rights and powers representing at least 40% ofthe holdings, rights and powers as a result of which A and C are taken to havecontrol of B.\n\t\tThe reference in subsection (2)(b) to interests, rights and powers does notinclude interests, rights or powers arising from shares held by a company if\u2014\n\t\t\ta profit on a sale of the shares would be treated as a trading receipt of atrade carried on by the company, and\n\t\t\tthe shares are not assets of an insurance company\u2019s long-term insurancefund.\n\t\tSection 474 makes provision about how this section operates where connectedcompanies or partnerships are involved.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section and section 474, a company (\u201cD\u201d) isconnected with another company (\u201cE\u201d) if\u2014\n\t\t\tD controls E,\n\t\t\tE controls D, or\n\t\t\tD and E are both controlled by the same company.\n\t\tSection 472 (meaning of \u201ccontrol\u201d) applies for the purposes of this sectionand section 474.\n\t\tIf two or more persons taken together have the power mentioned in section472(2) (as read with the other provisions of section 472) as respects theaffairs of a company (\u201cB\u201d), they are taken for the purposes of subsection(2)(a) to have control of B.\n\tTreatment of connected companies and partnerships for section 473\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 473(2), all the interests, rights and powers ofany company connected with another company are attributed to the other companybefore determining any question\u2014\n\t\t\twhether two persons taken together have control of a company at any time,or\n\t\t\twhether a person has at any time interests, rights and powers representingat least 40% of the holdings, rights and powers in respect of a company.\n\t\tIf section 1259 (calculation of firm\u2019s profits and losses) applies, anyproperty, rights or powers held or exercisable for the purposes of the firmare treated for the purposes of section 473, as respects any time in anaccounting period of the firm, on the basis of the assumptions in subsection(3).\n\t\tThe assumptions are that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe property, rights or powers had been apportioned between, and were heldor exercisable by, the partners in the firm severally, and\n\t\t\tthe apportionment was in the same shares as those in which the profit orloss of the accounting period would be apportioned between the partners underthe firm\u2019s profit-sharing arrangements.\n\t\tSubsection (5) applies if\u2014\n\t\t\ta trade or business is carried on by a firm, and\n\t\t\tthe firm stands in the position of a creditor or debtor as respects a moneydebt.\n\t\tThe questions in subsection (6) are to be determined as if each of thepartners in the firm separately, instead of the firm, stood in the position ofa creditor or, as the case may be, a debtor as respects the money debt to theextent of that partner\u2019s appropriate share (see subsection (8)).\n\t\tThe questions are\u2014\n\t\t\twhether a company has a major interest in another company for an accountingperiod in the case of a loan relationship, or\n\t\t\thow far any amount is treated under this Part in any particular way as aresult of a company having or, as the case may be, not having such a majorinterest.\n\t\tThe references to partners in subsections (3) and (5) do not include areference to the general partner of a limited partnership which is acollective investment scheme.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (5), a partner\u2019s \u201cappropriate share\u201d is thesame share as the partner\u2019s share under the firm\u2019s profit-sharing arrangementsof any profit or loss calculated in accordance with section 1259 for theaccounting period in question.\n\tMeaning of expressions relating to exchange gains and losses\n\t\tReferences in this Part to exchange gains or exchange losses, in relationto a company, are references respectively to\u2014\n\t\t\tprofits or gains which arise as a result of comparing at different timesthe expression in one currency of the whole or some part of the valuation putby the company in another currency on an asset or liability of the company, or\n\t\t\tlosses which so arise.\n\t\tIf the result of such a comparison is that neither an exchange gain nor anexchange loss arises, for the purposes of this Part an exchange gain of nil istaken to arise in the case of that comparison.\n\t\tThe Treasury may make provision by regulations as to the way in whichexchange gains or losses are to be calculated for the purposes of this sectionin a case where fair value accounting is used by the company.\n\t\tThe regulations may be made so as to apply to periods of account beginningbefore the regulations are made, but not earlier than the beginning of thecalendar year in which they are made.\n\t\tAny reference in this Part to an exchange gain or loss from a loanrelationship of a company is a reference to an exchange gain or loss arisingto a company in relation to an asset or liability representing a loanrelationship of the company."

introduction\n\t\t\tThis Chapter provides for Part 5 to apply to relevant non-lendingrelationships in relation to some matters as it applies to loan relationships(see section 481).\n\t\t\tFor the meaning of \u201crelevant non-lending relationship\u201d, see\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 479 (relevant non-lending relationships not involving discounts),and\n\t\t\t\tsection 480 (relevant non-lending

debtsetc).\n\t\tRelevant non-lending relationships not involving discounts\n\t\t\tA company has a relevant non-lending relationship if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe company stands, or has stood, in the position of a creditor or debtorin relation to a money debt,\n\t\t\t\tthe money debt did not arise from a transaction for the lending of money(and so, because of section 302(1)(b), there is no loan relationship), and\n\t\t\t\tthe money debt is one of the kinds mentioned in subsection (2).\n\t\t\tThe kinds of debt are\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta debt on which interest is payable to or by the company,\n\t\t\t\ta debt in relation to which exchange gains or losses arise to the company,and\n\t\t\t\ta debt in relation to which an impairment loss (or credit in respect of thereversal of an impairment loss) arises to the company in respect of an unpaid(or previously unpaid) business payment.\n\t\t\tIn subsection (2) \u201cbusiness payment\u201d means a payment which, if it werepaid, would fall to be brought into account for corporation tax purposes as areceipt of a trade, UK property business or overseas property business carriedon by the company.\n\t\t\tFor the meaning of \u201cmoney debt\u201d and \u201cinterest\u201d in this Chapter, see\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 483 (exchange gains and losses: amounts treated as money debts) and\n\t\t\t\tsection 484 (provision not at

section 485 (exclusion of debts where profits orlosses within Part 7 or 8).\n\t\tRelevant non-lending relationships involving discounts\n\t\t\tA company has a relevant non-lending relationship if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe company stands in the position of creditor in relation to a money debt,\n\t\t\t\tthe money debt did not arise from a transaction for the lending of money(and so, because of section 302(1)(b), there is no loan relationship),\n\t\t\t\tthe money debt is one from which a discount arises to the company,\n\t\t\t\tthe discount does not fall to be brought into account under section 509(treatment of alternative finance arrangements as loan relationships etc) as aresult of arrangements to which section 503 (purchase and resale arrangements)applies, and\n\t\t\t\tin a case where the money debt is some or all of the consideration payablefor a disposal of property, conditions A and B are met.\n\t\t\tCondition A is that the property in question is not\u2014\n\t\t\t\tan asset representing a loan relationship the disposal of which is adisposal to which subsection (3) applies, or\n\t\t\t\tan asset representing a derivative contract the disposal of which is such adisposal.\n\t\t\tThis subsection applies to a disposal if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 340 (group transfers and transfers of insurance business: transferat notional carrying value) applies to it or would apply apart from section341 (transferor using fair value accounting),\n\t\t\t\tsection 625 (group member replacing another as party to derivativecontract) applies to it or would apply apart from section 628 (transferorusing fair value accounting), or\n\t\t\t\tthe whole of the consideration for the disposal is brought into account forthe purposes of Part 5 (loan relationships) or Part 7 (derivative contracts).\n\t\t\tCondition B is that, assuming that the money debt will be paid in full, itdoes not fall to be brought into account for corporation tax purposes as atrading receipt of the company.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of this section, a discount is, in particular, taken toarise from a money debt if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthere is a sale of property for consideration some or all of which is moneywhich falls to be paid after the sale,\n\t\t\t\tthe amount or value of the whole consideration exceeds what the purchaserwould have paid for the property if payment in full had been required at thetime of the sale, and\n\t\t\t\tsome or all of the excess can reasonably be regarded as representing areturn on an investment of money at interest (and so as being a discountarising from the money debt).\n\t\t\tIt does not matter for the purposes of subsection (1)(c) whether thediscount is of a revenue or capital nature.\n\t\t\tThis section is subject to section 485 (exclusion of debts where profits orlosses within Part 7 or 8).\n\tApplication of Part 5 to relevant non-lending relationships\n\t\tApplication of Part 5 to relevant non-lending relationships\n\t\t\tIf a company has a relevant non-lending relationship\u2014\n\t\t\t\tPart 5 (loan relationships) applies in relation to the relevant matters(see subsections (3) and (5)) as it applies in relation to such mattersarising under or in relation to a loan relationship, but\n\t\t\t\tthe only credits or debits to be brought into account for the purposes ofthat Part in respect of the relationship are those relating to those matters.\n\t\t\tAccordingly, subject to subsection (1)(b), references in the CorporationTax Acts to a loan relationship include a reference to a relevant non-lendingrelationship.\n\t\t\tThe relevant matters in the case of a relevant non-lending relationshipwithin section 479 are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tinterest payable to or by the company in respect of the relevant non-lending relationship,\n\t\t\t\texchange gains or losses arising to the company as a result of therelationship,\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a debt on which interest is payable to the company, profits(but not losses) arising to the company from any related transaction inrespect of the right to receive interest,\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a debt in relation to which an impairment loss arises to thecompany in respect of an unpaid business payment, the impairment, and\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a debt in relation to which a credit in respect of thereversal of an impairment loss arises to the company in respect of apreviously unpaid business payment, the reversal.\n\t\t\tIn subsection (3) \u201cbusiness payment\u201d has the meaning given in section479(3).\n\t\t\tThe relevant matters in the case of a relevant non-lending relationshipwithin section 480 are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe matters referred to in subsection (3),\n\t\t\t\tthe discount arising to the company from the money debt,\n\t\t\t\tprofits (but not losses) arising to the company from any relatedtransaction,\n\t\t\t\tany impairment arising to the company in respect of the discount, and\n\t\t\t\tany reversal of any such impairment.\n\t\t\tSubsection (7) applies if a company\u2014\n\t\t\t\thas a relevant non-lending relationship within section 479 because of adebt on which interest is payable to the company, but\n\t\t\t\tenters into a related transaction in respect of the right to receiveinterest as a result of which interest is not so payable.\n\t\t\tEven though the interest is not payable to the

accounting period inaccordance with subsections (3) and (4) as if the relevant holding were rightsunder a creditor relationship of the company.\n\t\t\tThe credits and debits to be brought into account for the purposes of Part5 in respect of the company\u2019s relevant holdings are to be determined on thebasis of fair value accounting.\n\t\t\tBut a credit relating to distributions of an open-ended

and\n\t\t\tthe associated transactions condition.\n\t\tIn this Chapter\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe increasing value condition\u201d has the meaning given in section 527, \n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe redemption return condition\u201d has the meaning given in section 529, and \n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe associated transactions condition\u201d has the meaning given in section 532. \n\tThe increasing value condition\n\t\tThe increasing value condition is that the assets of the issuing companyare of such a nature that the fair value of the share\u2014\n\t\t\tis likely to increase at a rate which represents a return on an investmentof money at a commercial rate of interest, and\n\t\t\tis unlikely to deviate to a substantial extent from that rate of increase.\n\t\tFluctuations in value resulting from changes in exchange rates are ignoredfor the purposes of subsection (1).\n\t\tThe increasing value condition is not met if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe whole of the assets of the issuing company are income-producing (seesubsection (4)), or\n\t\t\tsubstantially the whole of them are income-producing on the basis of acalculation of their fair value.\n\t\tThe assets which are \u201cincome-producing\u201d for the purposes of this sectionare\u2014\n\t\t\tany share to which section 524 applies,\n\t\t\tany share as respects which the increasing value condition is met or wouldbe met apart from subsection (3),\n\t\t\tany share as respects which the condition in section 529(1)(b) is met,\n\t\t\tany share as respects which the associated transactions condition is met,\n\t\t\tany asset of a description specified in any paragraph of section 494(1)(meaning of \u201cqualifying investments\u201d),\n\t\t\trights under a creditor repo within the meaning of section 543,\n\t\t\tany share in a company\u2014\n\t\t\tthe whole of whose assets are assets within paragraphs (a) to (f), or\n\t\t\tsubstantially the whole of whose assets are such assets on the basis of acalculation of their fair value.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (1), it is assumed that no transaction (orseries of transactions) intended to prevent either of the conditions insubsection (1) from being met will be or has been entered into.\n\tRegulations about income-producing assets\n\t\tThe Treasury may by regulations amend section 527 for the purpose of addingto the assets which are income-producing for the purposes of that section.\n\t\tThe regulations may provide that they have effect in relation to accountingperiods ending on or after the day on which the regulations come into force.\n\tThe redemption return condition\n\t\tThe redemption return condition is that the share\u2014\n\t\t\tis redeemable (see subsection (2)),\n\t\t\tis designed to produce a return which equates, in substance, to the returnon an investment of money at a commercial rate of interest, and\n\t\t\tis not an excepted share (see section 530).\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section, a share is regarded as redeemable only ifit meets condition A, B or C.\n\t\tCondition A is that it is redeemable as a result of its terms of issue (orany collateral arrangements)\u2014\n\t\t\trequiring redemption,\n\t\t\tentitling the holder to require redemption, or\n\t\t\tentitling the issuing company to redeem.\n\t\tCondition B is that there are arrangements which will or might entitle theinvesting company to qualifying redemption amounts.\n\t\tIn subsection (4) \u201cqualifying redemption amounts\u201d means amounts which, whentaken together, are the same, or substantially the same, as an amount whichmight be payable on the redemption of the share.\n\t\tCondition C is that it is reasonable to assume that the investing companywill or might become entitled to qualifying redemption amounts.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\u201carrangements\u201d includes any agreement or understanding, and\n\t\t\tit does not matter whether or not the agreement or understanding\u2014\n\t\t\tis legally enforceable, or\n\t\t\tforms part of the share\u2019s terms of issue.\n\tThe redemption return condition: excepted shares\n\t\tA share is an \u201cexcepted share\u201d for the purposes of section 529 if\u2014\n\t\t\tit is a qualifying publicly issued share (see subsections (2) and (3)),\n\t\t\tit is a share which mirrors a public issue (see subsections (4) and (5)),or\n\t\t\tthe investing company\u2019s purpose in acquiring the share is not anunallowable purpose (see section 531).\n\t\tA share is a \u201cqualifying publicly issued share\u201d for the purposes of thissection if\u2014\n\t\t\tit was issued by a company as part of an issue of shares to persons notconnected with the company, and\n\t\t\tless than 10% of the shares in that issue are held by the investing companyor persons connected with it.\n\t\tBut a share is not a qualifying publicly issued share for those purposes ifthe investing company\u2019s purpose in acquiring the share is an unallowablepurpose because of section 531(1)(a).\n\t\tThe first case where shares (\u201cthe mirroring shares\u201d) mirror a public issueis where\u2014\n\t\t\ta company (\u201ccompany A\u201d) issues shares (\u201cthe public issue\u201d) to persons notconnected with the company,\n\t\t\twithin 7 days of that issue, one or more other companies (\u201ccompanies BB\u201d)issue the mirroring shares to company A on the same terms as the public issueor substantially the same terms,\n\t\t\tcompany A and companies BB are associated companies (see subsection (6)),and\n\t\t\tthe total nominal value of the mirroring shares does not exceed the nominalvalue of the public issue.\n\t\tThe second case where shares (\u201cthe second-level mirroring shares\u201d) mirror apublic issue is where, in the circumstances of the first case\u2014\n\t\t\twithin 7 days of the public issue, one or more other companies (companiesCC) issue the second-level mirroring shares to one or more of companies BB onthe same terms as the public issue or substantially the same terms,\n\t\t\tcompany A, companies BB and companies CC are associated companies, and\n\t\t\tthe total nominal value of the second-level mirroring shares does notexceed the nominal value of the public issue.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section companies are associated companies if theyare members of the same group of companies for the purposes of Chapter 4 ofPart 10 of ICTA (group relief) (see section 413(3)(a) of that Act).\n\tThe redemption return condition: unallowable purposes\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 530, a share is acquired by the investingcompany for an unallowable purpose if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe purpose for which the company holds the share or one of the mainpurposes is to circumvent section 130 (traders receiving distributions etc),or\n\t\t\tthe purpose for which it does so or one of the main purposes is any otherpurpose which is a tax avoidance purpose (see subsection (4)).\n\t\tThe condition in subsection (1)(a) is taken to be met, in particular, ifthe investing company was an associated company of a bank at the time when theinvesting company acquired the share.\n\t\tBut subsection (2) does not apply if the investing company shows that\u2014\n\t\t\timmediately before that time, some or all of its business consisted ofmaking and holding investments, and\n\t\t\tit acquired the share in the ordinary course of that business.\n\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cbank\u201d has the meaning given by section 840A of ICTA, and \n\t\t\t  * \u201ctax avoidance purpose\u201d, in relation to a company, means any purpose which consists of securing a tax advantage (whether for the company or another person). \n\t\tSection 530(6) (when companies are associated) applies for the purposes ofthis section as it applies for the purposes of section 530.\n\tThe associated transactions condition\n\t\tThe associated transactions condition is that there is a scheme orarrangement (whether or not the investing company is a party to it) underwhich the share and one or more associated transactions are together designedto produce a return for any one or more persons which equates, in substance,to the return on an investment of money at a commercial rate of interest.\n\t\tBut the associated transactions condition is not met if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe increasing value condition is met as respects the share or would beapart from section 527(3) (exception for income-producing assets), or\n\t\t\tthe redemption return condition is met as respects the share or would beapart from section 529(1)(c) (excepted shares).\n\t\tIn this section \u201cassociated transaction\u201d includes\u2014\n\t\t\tentering into or acquiring rights or liabilities under any of the kinds ofcontract specified in subsection (4), and\n\t\t\tacquiring rights or receiving benefits in respect of other shares.\n\t\tThe contracts referred to in subsection (3) are\u2014\n\t\t\ta derivative contract,\n\t\t\ta contract which would be a derivative contract, apart from section 591(3),\n\t\t\ta contract having a similar effect to a contract within paragraph (a) or(b), or\n\t\t\ta contract of insurance or indemnity.\n\tPower to change conditions for non-qualifying shares\n\t\tThe Treasury may by regulations amend this Chapter so as to add, vary orremove conditions to be met for the purposes of section 526(2) (non-qualifyingshares).\n\t\tIf the Treasury add, vary or remove such a condition, they may also byregulations amend any of the enactments specified in subsection (3) so as tomake provision for or in connection with taxation in the case of any asset ortransaction which is or was mentioned in the condition.\n\t\tThe enactments are\u2014\n\t\t\tPart 5,\n\t\t\tthis Part,\n\t\t\tPart 7 (derivative contracts),\n\t\t\tChapters 1 to 3 of Part 6 of ICTA (company distributions), and\n\t\t\tPart 18 of ICTA (double taxation relief).\n\t\tRegulations under this section may

5 and this Part as amoney debt which\u2014\n\t\t\tis owed to the lender or, if the lender is a member of a firm which makesthe advance, to the firm, and\n\t\t\tis owed by the person who initially sold the securities.\n\t\tThe arrangement is, in the case of the lender, to be treated for thepurposes of those rules as a transaction for the lending of money from whichthat debt is treated as arising for

treated for those purposes as received at the earlier of\u2014\n\t\t\tthe time when the relevant repurchase takes place, and\n\t\t\tthe time when it becomes apparent that that repurchase will not take

liability to the lender,\n\t\t\tas the case may be.\n\tRepo under arrangement designed to produce quasi-interest: taxavoidance\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\tunder an arrangement a person receives any money or other asset (\u201ctheadvance\u201d) from a company or a firm of which the company is a member,\n\t\t\tthe company does not have a creditor repo or creditor quasi-repo byreference to the arrangement, but would have one on the applicable accountingassumption (reading condition E in sections 543 and 544 in the light of thatassumption),\n\t\t\tthe arrangement is designed to produce a return (\u201cthe quasi-interest\u201d) tothe company or firm which equates, in substance, to the return on aninvestment of money at interest, and\n\t\t\tthe main purpose, or one

being party to such contracts\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Part, references to a relevant contract of acompany are references to a relevant contract entered into or acquired by thecompany (but see subsection (3)).\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Part, a relevant contract is acquired by a companyif the company becomes\u2014\n\t\t\tentitled to the rights under the relevant contract, and\n\t\t\tsubject to the liabilities under it.\n\t\tFor particular cases where companies are treated as parties to relevantcontracts, see\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 584 (hybrid derivatives with embedded

party to a relevant contractare to be read in accordance with this section.\n\tThe accounting conditions\n\t\tThe accounting conditions for any accounting period are that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe relevant contract is treated for accounting purposes as a derivative,\n\t\t\tthe relevant contract\u2014\n\t\t\tis not so treated just because of not meeting the requirement in paragraph9(b) of Financial Reporting Standard 26 issued in December 2004 by theAccounting Standards Board (requirement for no initial net investment orsmaller initial net investment than comparable types of contract), but\n\t\t\tis or forms part of a financial asset or liability for accountingpurposes, or\n\t\t\tthe relevant contract is not within paragraph (a) or (b), but is withinsubsection (2).\n\t\tA relevant contract is within this subsection if\u2014\n\t\t\tits underlying subject matter is commodities, or\n\t\t\tit is a contract for differences whose underlying subject matter is\u2014\n\t\t\tland, \n\t\t\ttangible movable property, other than commodities which are tangibleassets,\n\t\t\tintangible fixed assets,\n\t\t\tweather conditions, or\n\t\t\tcreditworthiness. \n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (1)(a), a relevant contract of a company istreated for accounting purposes as a derivative for an accounting period iffor that period\u2014\n\t\t\tit is so treated for the purposes of the relevant accounting standard usedby the company for that period, or\n\t\t\tit would be so treated if the company used the relevant accounting standardfor that period in respect of the

required or permittedto be used, Financial Reporting Standard 25 issued in December 2004 by theAccounting Standards Board, as from time to time modified, amended or revised,or\n\t\t\tfor any accounting period in relation to which it is required or permittedto be used, any subsequent accounting standard dealing with transactions whichare derivatives, as from time to time modified, amended or revised.\n\t\tFor the meaning of \u201cunderlying subject matter\u201d, see section 583.\n\t\u201cOption\u201d \n\t\tIn this Part \u201coption\u201d includes a warrant.\n\t\tReferences in this Part

of subsection (1)(b), an index or factor may be determinedby reference to any matter.\n\t\u201cUnderlying subject matter\u201d\n\t\tIn this Part references to the underlying subject matter of a relevantcontract are to be read as follows.\n\t\tThe underlying subject matter of an option is\u2014\n\t\t\tthe property which would fall to be delivered if the option were exercised,or\n\t\t\tif the property which would so fall is a derivative contract, theunderlying subject matter of that contract.\n\t\tThe underlying subject matter of a future is\u2014\n\t\t\tthe property which, if the future were to run to delivery, would fall to bedelivered at the date and price agreed when the contract is made, or\n\t\t\tif the property which would so fall is a derivative contract, theunderlying subject matter of that contract.\n\t\tThe underlying subject matter of a contract for differences is\u2014\n\t\t\tif the contract for differences relates to fluctuations in the value orprice of property described in the contract, the property so described, or\n\t\t\tif an index or factor is designated in the contract for differences, thematter by reference to which the index or factor is determined.\n\t\tThe things which may be the subject matter of a contract for differencesinclude\u2014\n\t\t\tinterest rates,\n\t\t\tweather conditions, and\n\t\t\tcreditworthiness. \n\t\tInterest rates are not the underlying subject matter of a relevant contractif\u2014\n\t\t\tunder the terms of that contract\u2014\n\t\t\tthe date on which a party to that contract becomes subject to a duty tomake a payment is a variable date, and\n\t\t\tthe amount of that payment varies according to the date of payment, and\n\t\t\tthose terms refer to an interest rate only for the purpose of establishingthat amount.\n\t\tThe underlying subject matter of a relevant contract is not treated asbeing\u2014\n\t\t\tland, \n\t\t\tshares in a company, or\n\t\t\trights of a unit holder under a unit trust scheme,\n\t\t\t\tjust because its underlying subject matter includes income from that kind ofproperty."

respect of the derivative contract are determined in accordance withsubsections (3) to (5).\n\t\t\tFor the accounting period in which the transaction or, as the case may be,the first of the

purposes) as if it were so brought into account, and\n\t\t\taccordingly may not be brought into account for any other corporation taxpurposes as respects that matter.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section and section 692, a credit is an exchangecredit, in the case of any company, so far as it is attributable to anyexchange gains arising to the company which are included in the reference toprofits of the company in section 595(3) (see section 606 (exchange gains andlosses from derivative contracts)).\n\t\tFor the meaning of \u201chas an unallowable purpose\u201d and \u201cthe unallowablepurpose\u201d in this section and section 692, see section 691.\n\tMeaning of \u201cunallowable purpose\u201d\n\t\tFor the purposes of sections 690 and 692, a derivative contract of acompany has an unallowable purpose in an accounting period if the purposes forwhich, at times during that period, the company\u2014\n\t\t\tis a party to the contract, or\n\t\t\tenters into transactions which are related transactions by reference to it,\n\t\t\t\tinclude a purpose (\u201cthe unallowable purpose\u201d) which is not amongst thebusiness or other commercial purposes of the company.\n\t\tIf a company is not within the charge to corporation tax in respect of apart of its activities, for the purposes of this section the business andother commercial purposes of the company do not include the purposes of thatpart.\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies if a tax avoidance purpose is one of the purposesfor which a company\u2014\n\t\t\tis a party to a derivative contract at any time, or\n\t\t\tenters into a transaction which is a related transaction by reference to aderivative contract of the company.\n\t\tFor the purpose of subsection (1), the tax avoidance purpose is onlyregarded as a business or other commercial purpose of the company if it isnot\u2014\n\t\t\tthe main purpose for which the company is a party to the derivativecontract or, as the case may be, enters into the related transaction, or\n\t\t\tone of the main purposes for which it is or does so.\n\t\tThe references in subsections (3) and (4) to a tax avoidance purpose arereferences to any purpose which consists of securing a tax advantage for thecompany or any other person.\n\t\tIn this section \u201ctax advantage\u201d has the meaning given by section 840ZA ofICTA (meaning of \u201ctax advantage\u201d).\n\tAllowance of accumulated net losses\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\tin any accounting period a derivative contract of a company has anunallowable purpose, and\n\t\t\tthere is a net loss in respect of that contract for that period.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section, there is such a net loss if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe sum of the debits in respect of that contract which are excluded frombeing brought into account for that period by section 690(3), exceeds\n\t\t\tthe sum of the exchange credits in respect of that contract which are soexcluded by section 690(2).\n\t\tThe amount of that excess is the amount of the net loss in respect of thecontract for the period.\n\t\tThe amount of the excess accumulated net losses in respect of the contractfor an accounting period is to be brought into account as a debit for thatperiod.\n\t\tThe amount of the excess accumulated net losses in respect of a contractfor an accounting period is found as follows.\n\t\t\t  * _Step 1_\n\t\t\tAdd together the amount of any net loss arising in respect of the contract forthat accounting period and earlier accounting periods.\n\t\t\t  * _Step 2_\n\t\tDeduct

Chapter provides for relief if a company realises an intangible fixedasset and incurs expenditure on other intangible fixed assets.\n\t\t\tIn this Chapter references to the \u201cold asset\u201d are references to the assetthat is realised and references to \u201cother assets\u201d are references to the otherassets on which expenditure is incurred.\n\t\t\tA company is entitled to relief under this Chapter only if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe conditions in section 755 are met in relation to the old asset and itsrealisation,\n\t\t\t\tthe conditions in section 756 are met in relation to the expenditure onother assets, and\n\t\t\t\tthe company claims the relief in accordance with section 757.\n\t\t\tSee also the following provisions (which extend or restrict thecircumstances in which relief is available)\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsections 777 to 779 (application of roll-over relief where there isreinvestment by group members),\n\t\t\t\tsection 791 (application of roll-over relief in relation to

roll-over relief), and\n\t\t\t\tsections 898 and 899 (roll-over relief for disposals of pre-FA 2002assets).\n\t\tConditions relating to the old asset and its realisation\n\t\t\tThe old asset must have been a chargeable intangible asset of the companythroughout the period during which it was held by the company (but seesubsection (5)).\n\t\t\tThe proceeds of realisation of the old asset must exceed\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe cost of the asset,\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a part realisation, the appropriate proportion of the costof the asset (see section 759(1) and (2)), or\n\t\t\t\tin the case of the realisation of an asset that has previously been thesubject of a part realisation, the adjusted cost of the asset (see section759(3)).\n\t\t\tIn subsection (2) \u201cthe cost of the asset\u201d means the total capitalisedexpenditure on the asset recognised for tax purposes.\n\t\t\tThe condition in subsection (2) is met if the old asset has no cost asdefined in subsection (3).\n\t\t\tSubsection (6) applies if the old asset was a chargeable intangible assetof the company\u2014\n\t\t\t\tat the time of its realisation, and\n\t\t\t\tfor a substantial proportion of the period during which it was held by thecompany, but not for the whole of that period.\n\t\t\tThe same proportion of the asset is treated for the purposes of thisChapter as if it were a separate asset in relation to which the condition insubsection (1) was wholly met.\n\t\t\tAny apportionment necessary for the purposes of subsections (5) and (6)must be made on a just and reasonable basis.\n\t\tConditions relating to expenditure on other assets\n\t\t\tThe expenditure on other assets must be incurred in the period\u2014\n\t\t\t\tbeginning 12 months before the date of realisation of the old asset or atsuch earlier time as an officer of Revenue and Customs may by notice allow,and\n\t\t\t\tending 3 years after the date of realisation of the old asset or at suchlater time as an officer of Revenue and Customs may by notice allow.\n\t\t\tThe expenditure on other assets must be capitalised by the company foraccounting purposes.\n\t\t\tImmediately after the expenditure is incurred the other assets must bechargeable intangible assets in relation to the company.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of this section expenditure is treated as incurred when itis recognised for accounting purposes.\n\t\tClaim for relief\n\t\t\tA claim by a company for relief under this Chapter must specify\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe old assets to which the claim relates,\n\t\t\t\tthe amount of the relief claimed in relation to each old asset, and\n\t\t\t\tin relation to each old asset, the expenditure on other assets by referenceto which relief is claimed.\n\tHow the relief is given\n\t\tHow the relief is given: general\n\t\t\tA company that is entitled to relief under this Chapter is treated for thepurposes of this Part as if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe proceeds of realisation of the old asset, and\n\t\t\t\tthe cost recognised for tax purposes of acquiring the other assets,\n\t\t\t\t\twere each reduced by the amount available for relief.\n\t\t\tIf the qualifying expenditure on other assets equals or exceeds theproceeds of realisation of the old asset, the amount available for relief isthe amount by which the proceeds of realisation exceed the cost of the oldasset.\n\t\t\tIf the qualifying expenditure on other assets is less than the proceeds ofrealisation of the old asset, the amount available for relief is the amount bywhich the qualifying expenditure on other assets exceeds the cost of the oldasset.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201cqualifying expenditure\u201d means expenditure in relation towhich the conditions in section 756 are met.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201cthe cost of the old asset\u201d means the total capitalisedexpenditure on the asset recognised for tax purposes, but\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin the case of a part realisation, references to the cost of the old assetare references to the appropriate proportion of the cost (see section 759(1)and (2)), and\n\t\t\t\tin the case of the realisation of an asset that has previously been thesubject of a part realisation, references to the cost of the old asset arereferences to the adjusted cost (see section 759(3)).\n\t\t\tThe relief does not affect the treatment of any other party to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tany transaction involved in the realisation of the old asset, or\n\t\t\t\tthe expenditure on the other assets,\n\t\t\t\tfor any purpose of the enactments relating to income tax, corporation tax orchargeable gains.\n\t\tDetermination of appropriate proportion of cost and adjusted cost\n\t\t\tIn the case of a part realisation, any reference in section 755 or 758 tothe appropriate proportion of the cost of the old asset is to the followingproportion of it\u2014\n\t\t\t\t[![](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_038)](/ukpga/2009/4/images/ukpga_20090004_en_038?view=plain)\n\t\t\twhere\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * AVB is the accounting value immediately before the part realisation, and \n\t\t\t\t  * AVA is the accounting value immediately after the part realisation. \n\t\t\tIf the old asset has previously been the subject of a part realisation, thereference in subsection (1) to the cost of the old asset is a reference to theadjusted cost.\n\t\t\tReferences in sections 755 and 758 and subsection (2) to the adjusted costare references to the cost of the old asset, less the sum of the amounts givenby subsections (1) and (2) in relation to earlier part realisations.\n\t\tReferences to cost of asset where asset affected by change ofaccounting policy\n\t\t\tIn the case of an asset to which Chapter 15 has applied (adjustments onchange of accounting policy) the references in this Chapter to the cost of theasset must be read as follows.\n\t\t\tIf section 872 (adjustments in respect of change) applied, the referencesare unaffected.\n\t\t\tIf section 874 or 876 (change of accounting policy involvingdisaggregation) applied, the references to the cost of the asset must be readas references to the appropriate proportion of that cost.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (3) the appropriate proportion is determinedby applying to the cost of the asset the same fraction as is applied bysection 875(2) or (3) or 876(3), as the case may be, to determine the taxwritten-down value of the asset after the change.\n\t\t\tReferences in this section to sections 872, 874, 875 and 876 includereferences to those provisions as applied by section 877 (election for fixed-rate writing down in relation to resulting asset).\n\t\tDeclaration of provisional entitlement to relief\n\t\t\tA company realising an intangible fixed asset may make a declaration ofprovisional entitlement to relief under this Chapter.\n\t\t\tWhile the declaration continues in force, this Chapter applies as if theconditions for relief under this Chapter were met.\n\t\t\tA declaration of provisional entitlement is a declaration by the company,in its company tax return for the accounting period in which the realisationtakes place, that the company\u2014\n\t\t\t\thas realised an intangible fixed asset,\n\t\t\t\tproposes to meet the conditions for relief under this Chapter, and\n\t\t\t\taccordingly is provisionally entitled to relief of a specified amount.\n\t\t\tA declaration of provisional entitlement ceases to have effect if or to theextent that\u2014\n\t\t\t\tit is withdrawn, or\n\t\t\t\tit is superseded by a claim for relief under this Chapter.\n\t\t\tSo far as not previously withdrawn or superseded, a declaration ofprovisional entitlement ceases to have effect 4 years after the end of theaccounting period in which the realisation took place.\n\t\t\tIf a declaration of provisional entitlement ceases to have effect, in wholeor in part, all necessary adjustments must be made, by assessment orotherwise.\n\t\t\tSubsection (6) applies despite any limitation on the time within whichassessments or amendments may be made.\n\t\tRealisation and reacquisition\n\t\t\tIf a company realises an asset and subsequently reacquires it, this Chapterapplies as if what is reacquired were a different asset from that previouslyrealised.\n\t\tDisregard of deemed realisations and reacquisitions\n\t\t\tThis Chapter does not apply in relation to a realisation of an asset thatdoes not actually occur but is treated as occurring, except as provided by\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 791 (application of roll-over relief in relation to degroupingcharge), or\n\t\t\t\tsection 794 (application of roll-over relief in relation to reallocatedcharge).\n\t\t\tReacquisitions that do not actually occur but are treated as occurring areignored for the purposes of this Chapter."

75% subsidiaries form a group, and\n\t\t\t\tif any of those subsidiaries have 75% subsidiaries, the group includes themand their 75% subsidiaries, and so on.\n\t\t\tA is referred to in this Chapter and in Chapter 9 as the principal companyof the group.\n\t\t\tSubsections (1) and (2) are subject to the following provisions of thisChapter.\n\t\tOnly effective 51% subsidiaries of principal company to be members ofgroup\n\t\t\tA group of companies does not include any company (other than the principalcompany of the group) that is not an effective 51% subsidiary of the principalcompany of the group.\n\t\t\tFor the meaning of \u201ceffective 51% subsidiary\u201d, see section 771.\n\t\tPrincipal company cannot be 75% subsidiary of another company\n\t\t\tThe general rule is that a company (\u201cA\u201d) is not the principal company of agroup if it is itself a 75% subsidiary of another company (\u201cB\u201d).\n\t\t\tThat rule is subject to subsection (3).\n\t\t\tA is the principal company of a group (\u201cgroup C\u201d) if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tA and B are prevented from being members of another group by section 766,\n\t\t\t\tthe requirements of sections 765 and 766 are met in

member of more than one group\n\t\t\tA company cannot be a member of more than one group.\n\t\t\tIf, apart from subsection (1), a company (\u201cA\u201d) would be a member of 2 ormore groups, the group of which it is a member is determined by applying therules in subsections (4), (6), (7) and (8) successively in that order until ananswer is obtained.\n\t\t\tIn those subsections the principal

bemembers of group) the amounts specified in subsection (5) were ignored.\n\t\t\tThose amounts are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tany amount to which a head of a group is beneficially entitled of anyprofits available for distribution to equity holders of a head of anothergroup (see section 772), and\n\t\t\t\tany amount to which a head of a group would be beneficially entitled of anyassets of a head of another

if) conditions Aand B are met.\n\t\t\tCondition A is that the parent is beneficially entitled to more than 50% ofany profits available for distribution to equity holders of the subsidiary(see section 772).\n\t\t\tCondition B is that the parent would be beneficially entitled to more than50% of any assets of the subsidiary available for distribution to its equityholders on a winding up (see section

relation to reallocated charge\n\t\tThis section applies where an election has been made under section 792 forthe purpose of enabling B to make a claim under Chapter 7 (roll-over relief onrealisation and reinvestment).\n\t\tChapter 7 applies as if the realisation of the asset treated as occurringunder section 780 or 785 had been by B, and not A.\n\t\tThe conditions in section 755 (conditions relating to the old asset) aretreated as met in relation to the asset if they would have been met if therehad been no election and A had made the claim.\n\t\tThe proceeds of realisation and the cost of the old asset recognised fortax purposes are what they would have been if there had been no election and Ahad made the claim.\n\t\tIf the election relates to only part of the gain on the realisation of anasset treated as occurring under section 780 or 785, Chapter 7 and thissection apply as if the realisation treated as occurring had been of aseparate asset representing a corresponding part of the asset.\n\t\tIf subsection (5) applies, any necessary apportionments must be madeaccordingly.\n\tRecovery of charge from another group company or controlling director\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\ta company (\u201cA\u201d) is liable to a degrouping charge,\n\t\t\tan amount of corporation tax has been assessed on A for the relevantaccounting period, and\n\t\t\tthe whole or part of that amount is unpaid at the end of the period of 6months after the time when it became payable.\n\t\tAn officer of Revenue and Customs may serve a notice on the persons to whomthis subsection applies (see subsections (3) and (4)) requiring them to paythe lesser of\u2014\n\t\t\tthe amount of corporation tax referable to the degrouping charge (seesection 796(2)), or\n\t\t\tthe amount that remains unpaid of the corporation tax payable for therelevant accounting period by A.\n\t\tIf A was a member of a group at the relevant time, subsection (2) appliesto\u2014\n\t\t\ta company that was at that time the principal company of the group, and\n\t\t\tany other company that at any time in the period of 12 months ending withthe relevant time\u2014\n\t\t\twas a member of that group, and\n\t\t\towned the relevant asset or any part of it.\n\t\tIf at the relevant time A is not UK resident but carries on a trade in theUnited Kingdom through a permanent establishment, subsection (2) applies toany person who is a controlling director\u2014\n\t\t\tof A,\n\t\t\tof a company that has control of A,\n\t\t\tof a company that had control of A within the period of 12 months endingwith the relevant time,\n\t\t\t\tor was such a controlling director during that period.\n\t\tSection 796 applies for the interpretation of this section and in thatsection references to \u201cA\u201d must be read in accordance with this section.\n\tInterpretation of section 795\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 795 and this section\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe relevant accounting period\u201d is the accounting period in which the degrouping charge falls to be brought into account by A, \n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe relevant time\u201d is\u2014 \n\t\t\tin a case within section 780, when A ceased to be a member of the group,\n\t\t\tin a case within section 785, when A ceased to meet the qualifying condition(within the meaning of that section), and\n\t\t\tif there has been an election under section 792, the time that would have beenthe relevant time under paragraph (a) or (b) had there been no such election,and\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cthe relevant asset\u201d is the asset in respect of which the degrouping charge arises. \n\t\tFor the purposes of section 795 the amount of corporation tax referable toa degrouping charge is the difference between\u2014\n\t\t\tthe tax in fact payable for the relevant accounting period, and\n\t\t\tthe tax that would have been payable for that period in the absence of thedegrouping charge.\n\t\tReferences in section 795 and this section to a degrouping charge are to\u2014\n\t\t\ta credit required to be brought into account under section 780(3) or785(4), or\n\t\t\tif there has been an election under section 792, a credit required to bebrought into account as a result of the election.\n\t\tIn section 795 and this section\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cdirector\u201d, in relation to a company\u2014 \n\t\t\thas the meaning given by section 67(1) of ITEPA 2003 (read with section 67(2)of that Act) and\n\t\t\tincludes any person falling within section 417(5) of ICTA (read with section417(6) of that Act),\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201ccontrolling director\u201d, in relation to a company, means a director of the company who has control of it, and \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cgroup\u201d and \u201cprincipal company\u201d have the meaning that would be given by Chapter 8 if in that Chapter for references to 75% subsidiaries there were substituted references to 51% subsidiaries. \n\t\tIn subsection (4) \u201ccontrol\u201d has the meaning given by section 416(2) to (6)of ICTA.\n\tRecovery under section 795: procedure etc\n\t\tA notice served under section 795(2) may require the payment of the amountrequired to be paid by the notice within 30 days of the service of the notice.\n\t\tThe notice must state\u2014\n\t\t\tthe amount of the tax referable to the degrouping charge (within themeaning given in section 796(2)),\n\t\t\tthe amount of corporation tax assessed on A for the relevant accountingperiod that remains unpaid,\n\t\t\tthe date when it first became payable, and\n\t\t\tthe amount required to be paid by the person on whom the notice is served.\n\t\tThe notice has effect\u2014\n\t\t\tfor the purposes of the recovery from that person of the amount required tobe paid and of interest on that amount, and\n\t\t\tfor the purposes of appeals,\n\t\t\t\tas if it were a notice of assessment and that amount were an amount of tax duefrom that person.\n\t\tA person who has paid an amount required to be paid by a notice undersection 795(2) may recover the amount paid from A.\n\t\tA payment required to be made by such a notice is not allowed as adeduction in calculating any income, profits or losses for any tax purposes.\n\t\tIn this section \u201cA\u201d and \u201cthe relevant accounting period\u201d have the samemeaning as in section 795 (see section 795(1) and section 796(1)respectively).\n\tRecovery under section 795: time limit\n\t\tA notice under section 795(2) must be served before the end of the periodof 3 years beginning with the date on which A\u2019s liability to corporation taxfor the relevant accounting period is finally determined.\n\t\tIn subsection (1) \u201cA\u201d and \u201cthe relevant accounting period\u201d have the samemeaning as in section 795 (see section 795(1) and section 796(1)respectively).\n\t\tIf the unpaid tax is charged because of a determination under paragraph 36or 37 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 (determination where no return delivered orreturn incomplete), the date mentioned in subsection (1) is the date on whichthe determination was made.\n\t\tIf the unpaid tax is charged in a self-assessment, the date mentioned insubsection (1) is the latest of\u2014\n\t\t\tthe last date on which notice of enquiry may be given into the returncontaining the self-assessment,\n\t\t\tif notice of enquiry is given, 30 days after the enquiry is completed,\n\t\t\tif more than one notice of enquiry is given, 30 days after the last noticeof completion,\n\t\t\tif after such an enquiry an officer of Revenue and Customs amends thereturn, 30 days after notice of the amendment is issued, and\n\t\t\tif an appeal is brought against such an amendment, 30 days after the appealis finally determined.\n\t\tIf the unpaid tax is

parties.\n\t\t\tSections 845 to 849 are about the rule that transfers between a company anda related party are treated as being at market value.\n\t\t\tSections 850 and 851 set out other rules for transactions involving relatedparties.\n\t\t\tSee Chapter 12 for the meaning of \u201crelated parties\u201d.\n\tTransfers treated as being at market value\n\t\tTransfer between company and related party treated as at market value\n\t\t\tThe basic rule is that a transfer of an intangible asset\u2014\n\t\t\t\tfrom a company to a related party, or\n\t\t\t\tto a company from a related party,\n\t\t\t\t\tis treated for all purposes of the Taxes Acts as being at market value (asrespects both the company and the related party) if condition A or B is met.\n\t\t\tCondition A is that the asset is a chargeable intangible asset in relationto the transferor immediately before the transfer.\n\t\t\tCondition B is that the asset is a chargeable intangible asset in relationto the transferee immediately after the transfer.\n\t\t\tThat rule is subject to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 846 (transfers not at arm\u2019s length),\n\t\t\t\tsection 847 (transfers involving other taxes),\n\t\t\t\tsection 848 (tax-neutral transfers), and\n\t\t\t\tsection 849 (transfers involving gifts of business assets).\n\t\t\tIn subsection (1)\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cmarket value\u201d means the price the asset might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market, and \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cthe Taxes Acts\u201d means the enactments relating to income tax, corporation tax or chargeable gains. \n\t\tTransfers not at arm\u2019s length\n\t\t\tSection 845 does not apply if the consideration for the transfer\u2014\n\t\t\t\tfalls to be adjusted for tax purposes under Schedule 28AA to ICTA(provision not at arm\u2019s length), or\n\t\t\t\tfalls within that Schedule without falling to be so adjusted.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (1)(b) the consideration for a transferfalls within that Schedule without falling to be adjusted under it if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe conditions in paragraph 1(1) of that Schedule are met, but\n\t\t\t\tthe actual provision does not differ from the arm\u2019s length provision.\n\t\t\tIn subsection (2) \u201cthe actual provision\u201d and \u201cthe arm\u2019s length provision\u201dhave the same meaning as in that Schedule (see paragraph 1(1) and paragraph1(2) and (3) of that Schedule respectively).\n\t\tTransfers involving other taxes\n\t\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin a case where section 845(1) applies and the asset is transferred fromthe company to a related party, the transfer is at less than its market value,\n\t\t\t\tin a case where that section applies and the asset is transferred to thecompany from the related party, the transfer is at more than its market value,and\n\t\t\t\tconditions A and B apply.\n\t\t\tCondition A is that the related party\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis not a company, or\n\t\t\t\tis a company in relation to which the asset is not a chargeable intangibleasset immediately after the transfer to it or, as the case may be, immediatelybefore the transfer from it.\n\t\t\tCondition B is that the transfer\u2014\n\t\t\t\tgives rise to an amount to be taken into account in calculating anyperson\u2019s income, profits or losses for tax purposes because of a relevantprovision, or\n\t\t\t\twould do so apart from section 845(1).\n\t\t\tIf this section applies, section 845(1) does not apply in relation to thecalculation referred to in subsection (3) for the purposes of any relevantprovision.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201crelevant provision\u201d means\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 209 of ICTA (meaning of \u201cdistribution\u201d), and\n\t\t\t\tPart 3 of ITEPA 2003 (employment income: earnings and benefits etc treatedas earnings).\n\t\tTax-neutral transfers\n\t\t\tSection 845 does not apply if the transfer is tax-neutral for the purposesof this Part as a result of any provision in this Part.\n\t\t\tFor such provisions, see, in particular\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 775 (transfers within a group), and\n\t\t\t\tsections 818 to 826 (transfer of business or trade).\n\t\tTransfers involving gifts of business assets\n\t\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe asset is transferred to the company mentioned in section 845(1), and\n\t\t\t\ton a claim for relief under section 165 of TCGA 1992 (relief for gifts ofbusiness assets) in respect of the transfer, a reduction is made under section165(4)(a).\n\t\t\tThe transfer is treated for the purposes of this Part as being at marketvalue, less the amount of the reduction.\n\t\t\tAny necessary adjustments may be made, by way of assessment, amendment ofreturns or otherwise, regardless of any relevant time limits.\n\tOther rules\n\t\tPart realisation involving related party acquisition: exclusion ofroll-over relief\n\t\t\tChapter 7 (roll-over relief in case of realisation and reinvestment) doesnot apply in relation to the part realisation by a company of an intangiblefixed asset if there is a related party acquisition as a result of, or inconnection with, the part realisation.\n\t\t\tFor this purpose there is a related party acquisition if a person who is arelated party in relation to the company acquires an interest of anydescription\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin the intangible fixed asset, or\n\t\t\t\tin an asset whose value is derived in whole or in part from that asset.\n\t\tDelayed payment of royalty by company to related party\n\t\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta royalty is payable by a company to or for the benefit of a related party,\n\t\t\t\tthe royalty is not paid in full within the period of 12 months after theend of the period of account in which a debit in respect of it is recognisedby the company for accounting purposes, and\n\t\t\t\tcredits representing the full amount of the royalty are not brought intoaccount under this Part in any accounting period by the person to whom it ispayable.\n\t\t\tThe royalty is brought into account for the purposes of this Part only whenit is paid."

ofpatent rights (see sections 912 and 913),\n\t\t\t\tcontains provision about how the amount chargeable is taxed (see sections914 to 918), and\n\t\t\t\tcontains related provision, including provision relevant to the applicationof the Chapter (see sections 919 to 923).\n\t\t\tSection 848 of ITA 2007, under which a sum representing income tax deductedunder section 910 of that Act (deduction from payment to non-UK residents inrespect of sale of patent rights) is treated as income tax paid by therecipient, is also relevant to the tax treatment of payments made to non-UKresident companies in respect of sales of patent rights.\n\tCharge to tax\n\t\tCharge to tax on profits from sales of patent rights\n\t\t\tThe charge to corporation tax on income applies to profits from sales by acompany of the whole or part of any patent rights.\n\t\t\tSubsection (1) applies in the case of a non-UK resident company if thepatent is granted under the laws of the United Kingdom.\n\t\t\tIn this Chapter \u201cpatent rights\u201d means the right to do or authorise thedoing of anything which, but for the right, would be an infringement of apatent.\n\t\tProfits charged under section 912\n\t\t\tA company\u2019s profits from the sale of the whole or part of patent rightsare\u2014\n\t\t\t\tany capital sum comprised in the proceeds of sale, less\n\t\t\t\tthe deductible costs.\n\t\t\tThe deductible costs are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe capital cost (if any) of the rights sold, and\n\t\t\t\tany incidental expenses incurred by the company in connection with thesale.\n\t\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tthe company acquired the rights sold, or the rights out of which they weregranted, by purchase,\n\t\t\t\tthe company has previously sold part of the purchased rights, and\n\t\t\t\tthe proceeds of that sale, after deducting any incidental expenses,consisted wholly or partly of a capital sum,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe capital cost is reduced by that sum.\n\t\t\tReferences in this Chapter to the capital cost of patent rights are to anycapital sum included in any price paid by the company to purchase\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe rights, or\n\t\t\t\tthe rights out of which they were granted.\n\t\t\tThis section needs to be read with sections 924 (relief for expenses:patent income) and 926 (contributions to expenditure).\n\tSpreading of charge to tax\n\t\tUK resident companies: proceeds of sale not received in instalments\n\t\t\tThis section applies if a company liable for tax under section 912\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis UK resident, and\n\t\t\t\tdoes not receive the proceeds of sale in instalments.\n\t\t\tThe appropriate fraction of the amount chargeable is taxed\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin the accounting period in which the company receives the proceeds of sale(\u201cthe period of receipt\u201d), and\n\t\t\t\tin successive accounting periods, until the expiry of the 6-year periodbeginning at the start of the period of receipt.\n\t\t\tThe appropriate fraction is the same fraction of the amount chargeable asthe accounting period in question is of 6 years (or, in the last period, suchsmaller fraction of that amount as has not already been taxed).\n\t\t\tThe company may elect that the whole of the amount chargeable is to betaxed instead in the period of receipt.\n\t\t\tAn election under subsection (4) must be made within the two-year periodbeginning at the end of the period of receipt.\n\t\tUK resident companies: proceeds of sale received in instalments\n\t\t\tThis section applies if a company liable for tax under section 912\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis UK resident, and\n\t\t\t\treceives the proceeds of sale in instalments.\n\t\t\tThe appropriate fraction of the amount chargeable in respect of eachinstalment is taxed\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin the accounting period in which the company receives the instalment (\u201ctheperiod of receipt\u201d), and\n\t\t\t\tin successive accounting periods, until the expiry of the 6-year periodbeginning at the start of the period of receipt.\n\t\t\tThe appropriate fraction of the amount chargeable in respect of aninstalment is the same fraction of that amount as the accounting period inquestion is of 6 years (or, in the last period, such smaller fraction of theamount as has not already been taxed).\n\t\t\tThe company may elect that the whole of any instalment is to be taxedinstead in the period of receipt.\n\t\t\tAn election under subsection (4) must be made within the two-year periodbeginning at the end of the period of receipt.\n\t\tNon-UK resident companies: proceeds of sale not received ininstalments\n\t\t\tThis section applies if a company liable for tax under section 912\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis not UK resident, and\n\t\t\t\tdoes not receive the proceeds of sale in instalments.\n\t\t\tThe whole of the amount chargeable is taxed in the accounting period inwhich the company receives the proceeds (\u201cthe period of receipt\u201d).\n\t\t\tThe company may elect instead that the amount chargeable\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis to be treated as arising rateably in the accounting periods ending 6years from the start of the period of receipt, and\n\t\t\t\tis taxed accordingly.\n\t\t\tAn election under subsection (3) must be made within the two-year periodbeginning at the end of the period of receipt.\n\t\t\tThe election has effect in relation to accounting periods of the companyduring which the company is within the charge to corporation tax in respect ofany proceeds of the sale not consisting of a capital sum.\n\t\t\tSuch repayments and assessments are to be made for each of the accountingperiods affected as are necessary to give effect to the election.\n\t\t\tSubsection (6) is subject to the qualifications in section 920 (adjustmentswhere tax has been deducted).\n\t\tNon-UK resident companies: proceeds of sale received in instalments\n\t\t\tThis section applies if a company liable for tax under section 912\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis not UK resident, and\n\t\t\t\treceives the proceeds of sale in instalments.\n\t\t\tThe amount chargeable in respect of each instalment is taxed in theaccounting period in which the company receives the instalment (\u201cthe period ofreceipt\u201d).\n\t\t\tThe company may, for any instalment, elect instead that the amountchargeable in respect of the instalment\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis to be treated as arising rateably in the accounting periods ending 6years from the start of the period of receipt, and\n\t\t\t\tis taxed accordingly.\n\t\t\tAn election under subsection (3) must be made within the two-year periodbeginning at the end of the period of receipt.\n\t\t\tThe election has effect in relation to accounting periods of the companyduring which the company is within the charge to corporation tax in respect ofany proceeds of the sale not consisting of a capital sum.\n\t\t\tSuch repayments and assessments are to be made for each of the accountingperiods affected as are necessary to give effect to the election.\n\t\t\tSubsection (6) is subject to the qualifications in section 920 (adjustmentswhere tax has been deducted).\n\t\tWinding up of a body corporate\n\t\t\tIf a body corporate which is liable for tax under section 912 commences tobe wound up, any amounts falling within subsection (2) are taxed in theaccounting period in which the winding up commences.\n\t\t\tThe amounts are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tany amounts which would have been chargeable in later accounting periodsunder section 914(2) or 915(2) (UK resident companies: spreading of charge totax), and\n\t\t\t\tany amounts which would have been chargeable in later accounting periodsunder section 916(3) or 917(3) (non-UK resident companies: election to spreadcharge to tax).\n\tMiscellaneous\n\t\tDeduction of tax from payments to non-UK resident companies\n\t\t\tThis section applies if a non-UK resident company is liable for tax undersection 912 on profits from the sale of the whole or part of any patentrights.\n\t\t\tThe rules in section 913 allowing the capital cost (if any) of the rightssold to be deducted in calculating the profits from the sale do not affect theamount of income tax which is to be deducted under section 910 of ITA 2007.\n\t\t\tNo election made by the company under section 916(3) or 917(3) (election tospread charge to tax) in relation to the proceeds of sale or any instalmentaffects the amount of income tax which is to be deducted under section 910 ofITA 2007.\n\t\tAdjustments where tax has been deducted\n\t\t\tWhere any sum has been deducted from a payment under section 910 of ITA 2007,any adjustment necessary\u2014\n\t\t\t\tbecause of section 919(2), or\n\t\t\t\tbecause of an election under section 916(3) or 917(3),\n\t\t\t\tmust be made by way of repayment of tax.\n\t\tLicences connected with patents\n\t\t\tThe acquisition of a licence in respect of a patent is treated for thepurposes of this Chapter as a purchase of patent rights.\n\t\t\tThe grant of a licence in respect of a patent is treated for the purposesof this Chapter as a sale of part of patent rights.\n\t\t\tBut the grant by a person entitled to patent rights of an exclusive licenceis treated for the purposes of this Chapter as a sale of the whole of thoserights.\n\t\t\tIn subsection (3) \u201cexclusive licence\u201d means a licence to exercise therights to the exclusion of the grantor and all other persons for the periodremaining until the rights come to an end.\n\t\tRights to acquire future patent rights\n\t\t\tIf a sum is paid to obtain a right to acquire future patent rights, thenfor the purposes of this Chapter\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe payer is treated as purchasing patent rights for that sum, and\n\t\t\t\tthe recipient is treated as selling patent rights for that sum.\n\t\t\tIf a person\u2014\n\t\t\t\tpays a sum to obtain a right to acquire future patent rights, and\n\t\t\t\tsubsequently acquires those rights,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe expenditure is to be treated for the purposes of this Chapter as havingbeen expenditure on the purchase of those rights.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201ca right to acquire future patent rights\u201d means a right toacquire in the future patent rights relating to an invention in respect ofwhich the patent has not yet been granted.\n\t\tSums paid for Crown use etc treated as paid under licence\n\t\t\tThis section applies if an invention which is the subject of a patent isused by or for the service of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe Crown under sections 55 to 59 of the Patents Act [1977 (c.37)](/id/ukpga/1977/37?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\"), or\n\t\t\t\tthe government of a country outside the United Kingdom under correspondingprovisions of the law of that country.\n\t\t\tThe use is treated for the purposes of this Chapter as having taken

company\u2019s share of the residuary income of the estatethat is attributable to that interest for that accounting period and eachprevious accounting period during which the company had that interest (seesections 949 to 951).\n\t\t\t  * _Step 2_\n\t\tIf the estate is a UK estate in relation to any tax year by reference to whichthe amount of that share for any accounting period is determined under section950, deduct from that amount income tax on that amount at the applicable ratefor that year (see section 952).\n\t\t\t  * _Step 3_\n\t\tAdd together the amounts found under step 1 after making any deductionsnecessary under step 2.\n\t\t\t  * _Step 4_\n\t\tAdd together the basic amounts relating to the company\u2019s absolute interest inrespect of which the company was liable for corporation tax for all previousaccounting periods (or would have been so liable if the company had been acompany liable for corporation tax for those accounting periods).\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Chapter the company has an assumed incomeentitlement for the accounting period if the amount resulting from step 3exceeds the amount resulting from step 4.\n\t\tThe assumed income entitlement is equal to the excess.\n\t\tThis section is subject to\u2014\n\t\t\t  * section 954 (successive absolute interests), and \n\t\t\t  * section 955 (successive interests: assumed income entitlement of holder of absolute interest following limited interest). \n\tResiduary income of the estate\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Chapter the residuary income of an estate for atax year is the aggregate income of the estate for that year, less theallowable estate deductions for that year.\n\t\tThe allowable estate deductions for a tax year are\u2014\n\t\t\tall interest paid in that year by the personal representatives in thatcapacity (but see section 233(3) of IHTA 1984: exclusion of interest on unpaidinheritance tax),\n\t\t\tall annual payments for that year which are properly payable out ofresidue,\n\t\t\tall payments made in that year in respect of expenses incurred by thepersonal representatives in that capacity in the management of the assets ofthe estate, and\n\t\t\tany excess deductions from the previous tax year.\n\t\t\t\tThis is subject to subsections (3) to (5).\n\t\tNo sum is to be treated as an allowable estate deduction if it is allowablein calculating the aggregate income of the estate.\n\t\tNo sum is to be counted twice as an allowable estate deduction.\n\t\tPayments in respect of expenses are only allowable estate deductions ifthey are properly chargeable to income (ignoring any specific direction in awill).\n\t\tIn this section \u201cexcess deductions from the previous tax year\u201d means somuch of the allowable deductions for the previous tax year as exceeded theaggregate income of the estate for that year.\n\tShares of residuary income of estate\n\t\tIn the case of a company which has an absolute interest in the whole of theresidue of an estate for a whole tax year, the company\u2019s share of theresiduary income of the estate in respect of that interest for that year isequal to the whole of that income for that year.\n\t\tIn the case of a company which\u2014\n\t\t\thas an absolute interest in the whole of the residue of an estate for partof the tax year, or\n\t\t\tan absolute interest in part of the residue of an estate for the whole orpart of the tax year,\n\t\t\t\tthe company\u2019s share of the residuary income of the estate for that year is aproportionate part of that income for that year.\n\t\tThe company\u2019s share of the residuary income of an estate in respect of anabsolute interest for each of the accounting periods (if more than one)comprising a tax year is found by apportioning the company\u2019s share of theresiduary income of the estate for that year between the accounting periods.\n\t\tSubsections (1) and (2) are subject to section 951 (reduction in share ofresiduary income of estate).\n\tReduction in share of residuary income of estate\n\t\tThis section applies if a company has an absolute interest in the whole orpart of the residue of an estate at the end of the administration period and\u2014\n\t\t\tthe total of the company\u2019s shares of the residuary income of the estate inrespect of that interest for all tax years (apart from this section), exceeds\n\t\t\tthe total of all sums paid during or payable at the end of theadministration period in respect of that interest to any person (grossed upwhere subsection (5) applies).\n\t\tIn the final accounting period the company\u2019s share of the residuary incomeof the estate is to be reduced by that excess.\n\t\tIf that excess is greater than the company\u2019s share of that income for thefinal accounting period, the company\u2019s share of that income for the previousaccounting period is to be reduced, and so on.\n\t\tIf subsection (3) applies, all necessary adjustments and repayments ofcorporation tax are to be made.\n\t\tFor the purposes of calculating the total mentioned in subsection (1)(b)\u2014\n\t\t\tif the estate is a UK estate in relation to a tax year in which a sum ispaid, the sum is to be grossed up by reference to the basic rate for thatyear, and\n\t\t\tif the estate is a UK estate in relation to the final tax year, a sumpayable at the end of the administration period is to be grossed up byreference to the basic rate for that year.\n\t\tFor the application of this section where two or more absolute interests inthe whole or the same part of the residue are held successively by differentpersons, see section 954(5) and (6).\n\tApplicable rate for determining assumed income entitlement (UKestates)\n\t\tThe applicable rate by reference to which income tax on a company\u2019s shareof the residuary income of the estate is calculated for the purposes of step 2of the calculation in section 948(1) depends on the rate at which income taxis borne by the aggregate income of the estate for the tax year in question.\n\t\tIf the aggregate income of the estate all bears income tax at the samerate, the applicable rate is that rate.\n\t\tIf different parts of the aggregate income of the estate bear income tax atdifferent rates, the applicable rate is the rate that applies to the income towhich the company\u2019s share of the residuary income of the estate relates.\n\t\tIf different rates apply to different parts of that income, each of thoserates is the applicable rate that applies to the corresponding part of theincome to which the company\u2019s share of the residuary income of the estaterelates.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section, if there is more than one person with anabsolute interest in the residue of the estate, such apportionments of partsof the aggregate income of the estate bearing income tax at different ratesare to be made as are just and reasonable for their different interests.\n\t\tSection 650(1) of ITTOIA 2005 (absolute interests)

during theadministration period by different persons.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section and those sections, two interests are heldsuccessively even where one is not held immediately before or after the other.\n\t\tIt is assumed for the purposes of those sections\u2014\n\t\t\tthat each of the persons holding the interests in question is a companywithin the charge to corporation tax (but without prejudice to the referencesto interests ceasing otherwise than by death), and\n\t\t\tthat in the case of a person who is not a company the person\u2019s accountingperiods correspond with tax years.\n\tSuccessive absolute interests\n\t\tThis section applies if two or more absolute interests in the whole or partof the residue of an estate are held successively during the administrationperiod by different persons.\n\t\tIn determining whether a company with a later such interest (\u201cthe laterholder\u201d) has an assumed income entitlement in respect of that interest and, ifso, its amount\u2014\n\t\t\tthe later holder\u2019s share of the residuary income of the estate in respectof that interest for any accounting period is to be treated as including theshare of any person with a previous such interest (\u201ca previous holder\u201d), and\n\t\t\tthe basic amounts relating to the later holder\u2019s interest are to be treatedas including the basic amounts relating to any previous such interest.\n\t\tIn applying subsection (2), all determinations under that subsection orsection 955(2) that fall to be made in relation to a person with an earlierinterest are to be made before determinations under those provisions relatingto a person with a later interest.\n\t\tA company which is a previous holder in the final accounting period is tobe taxed for that period, in relation to the interest as to which that companyis a previous holder, as if that period were not the final accounting period,and the later holder\u2019s assumed income entitlement is to be calculatedaccordingly (or, where the previous holder is not a company, having regard tothe application of section 671(4) of ITTOIA 2005 to the previous holder).\n\t\tThe calculation under section 951(1)(a) and (b) (amount of reduction in theshare of the residuary income of the company with an absolute interest at theend of the administration period) is to be made by reference to all theabsolute interests taken together.\n\t\tIf the amount resulting from that calculation is greater than the totalamount of the reductions which can be made under section 951(2) and (3), theshare of the residuary income of the estate of the last previous holder of theinterest for the last accounting period in which that last holder had thatinterest is to be reduced, and so on.\n\t\tBut if subsection (6) applies in a case where the last previous holder orany earlier previous holder is not a company, in applying that subsectionregard must be had to the application of section 671(6) of ITTOIA 2005 to theprevious holder.\n\tAssumed income entitlement of holder of absolute interest followinglimited interest\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\ttwo or more interests in the whole or part of the residue of an estate areheld successively during the administration period by different persons,\n\t\t\teach later interest arises or is created on the cessation of the previousinterest otherwise than by death,\n\t\t\tat least one of the interests is an absolute interest, and\n\t\t\tat least one of the interests preceding that interest is a limitedinterest.\n\t\tRules A and B apply to determine in relation to such an absolute interest\u2014\n\t\t\twhether the company with the interest has an assumed income entitlement inrespect of the interest, and\n\t\t\tif so, its amount.\n\t\tRule A is that the company\u2019s share of the residuary income of the estate inrespect of the absolute interest for any accounting period is treated asincluding any amount which would be included in it if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe interest had subsisted throughout the period when any such limitedinterest subsisted, and\n\t\t\tno such limited interest had ever subsisted.\n\t\tRule B is that the basic amounts relating to the absolute interest aretreated as including the basic amounts relating to any such limited interest.\n\tPayments in respect of limited interests followed by absoluteinterests\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\ttwo or more interests in the whole or part of the residue of an estate areheld successively during the administration period by different persons,\n\t\t\teach later interest arises or is created on the cessation of the previousinterest otherwise than by death,\n\t\t\tat least one of the interests is an absolute interest, and\n\t\t\tat least one of the interests preceding that interest is a limitedinterest.\n\t\tA sum to which a company (\u201cC\u201d) with such an absolute interest is entitledin respect of any such limited interest which is paid while C has the absoluteinterest is treated as paid in respect of the absolute interest (and not thelimited interest).\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies if\u2014\n\t\t\tC\u2019s absolute interest ceases during the administration period, and\n\t\t\ta sum to which C is entitled in respect of any such limited interest\u2014\n\t\t\tis paid after the absolute interest ceases but before the end of theadministration period, or\n\t\t\tremains payable at the end of it.\n\t\tThis Chapter applies as respects any such sum as if the limited interesthad continued to subsist while that absolute interest subsisted and had beenheld by C.\n\t\tSubsection (4) is subject to subsection (6).\n\t\tFor the purposes only of section 951 (reduction in share of residuaryincome of estate), any such sum is treated as paid or payable in respect ofthe absolute interest.\n\tHolders of limited interests\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\ttwo or more interests in the whole or part of the residue of an estate areheld successively during the administration period by different persons,\n\t\t\tthe earlier or, if there are more than two, the earliest of the interestsis a limited interest,

the residue of the estate in an accounting period in cases A, B and C.\n\t\tCase A is where\u2014\n\t\t\tone of the successive interests subsists at the beginning of the accountingperiod of a company which has or has had one of the interests which is alimited interest (the \u201climited holder\u201d),\n\t\t\ta sum is paid in respect of one of the interests in that period and beforethe end of the administration period, and\n\t\t\tthe limited holder is entitled to receive the payment.\n\t\tCase B is where\u2014\n\t\t\tthe accounting period of a limited holder is the final accounting period,\n\t\t\tone of the successive interests subsists at the beginning of that period,\n\t\t\ta sum remains payable in respect of one of the interests at the end of theadministration period, and\n\t\t\tthe limited holder is entitled to receive the payment.\n\t\tCase C is where\u2014\n\t\t\tthe accounting period of a limited holder is a period before the finalaccounting period,\n\t\t\tthe last of the successive interests ceases in the accounting period,\n\t\t\ta sum is either\u2014\n\t\t\tpaid in respect of one of the interests in a later accounting period butbefore the end of the administration period, or\n\t\t\tremains payable in respect of it at the end of the administration period,and\n\t\t\tthe limited holder is entitled to receive the payment.\n\tBasic amount of estate income: successive limited interests\n\t\tThe basic amount of estate income relating to a limited interest withinsection 957 for an accounting period is the total of the sums within section957(3)(b), (4)(c) and (5)(c) for that period.\n\tApportionments \n\t\tSuch apportionments as are just and reasonable are to be made for thepurposes of this Chapter if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe part of a residuary estate

given.\n\t\t\tSections 1022 and 1023 deal with cases in which a person obtains an optionto acquire shares in a company and that company is subsequently taken over.\n\t\t\tSection 1024 provides for relief to be given to a successor company if thequalifying business is transferred by group transfers.\n\tRequirements to be met for relief to be available\n\t\tBasic requirements for relief under Chapter 3\n\t\t\tRelief under this Chapter is available to a company (\u201cthe employingcompany\u201d) if\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta person (\u201cthe employee\u201d) has employment with the employing company,\n\t\t\t\tthat employment (\u201cthe relevant employment\u201d) is in relation to a businesswithin subsection (2) (\u201cthe qualifying business\u201d),\n\t\t\t\tthe employee or another person

1016 and 1017 are met as mentioned inthose sections.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe person who obtains the option is, in that capacity, called \u201ctherecipient\u201d.\n\t\t\tA business is within this subsection so far as\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe business is carried on by the employing company, and\n\t\t\t\tthe employing company is within the charge to corporation tax in relationto the profits of the business.\n\t\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tthe recipient dies, and\n\t\t\t\tsubsequently another person acquires shares pursuant to the option,\n\t\t\t\tthis Chapter applies as if the recipient were alive and the shares wereacquired by the recipient.\n\t\tConditions relating to shares acquired\n\t\t\tEach of the following conditions must be met in relation to the sharesacquired.\n\t\t\t\t  * _Condition 1_\n\t\t\t\tThe shares are ordinary shares that are fully paid-up and not redeemable.\n\t\t\t\t  * _Condition 2_\n\t\t\tThe shares are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tshares of a class listed on a recognised stock exchange,\n\t\t\t\tshares in a company that is not under the control of another company, or\n\t\t\t\tshares in a company that is under the control of a listed company.\n\t\t\t\t\t  * _Condition 3_\n\t\t\t\tThe shares are shares in\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe employing company,\n\t\t\t\ta company that, when the option is obtained, is a parent company of theemploying company,\n\t\t\t\ta company that, when the option is obtained, is a member of a consortium thatowns the employing company,\n\t\t\t\ta company that, when the option is obtained, is a member of a consortium thatowns a parent company of the employing company,\n\t\t\t\ta company within subsection (2), or\n\t\t\t\ta qualifying successor company (see section 1022).\n\t\t\tA company (\u201ccompany A\u201d) is within this subsection if when the option isobtained\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe employing company or a parent company of the employing company is amember of a consortium that owns another company (\u201ccompany B\u201d), and\n\t\t\t\tcompany A is\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta member of that consortium or a parent company of a member of thatconsortium, and\n\t\t\t\ta member of the same commercial association of companies as company B.\n\t\tCondition relating to employee\u2019s income tax position\n\t\t\tThe following condition must be met in relation to the income tax positionof the employee.\n\t\t\t\t  * _The Condition_\n\t\t\t\tThe acquisition of the shares is a chargeable event in relation to theemployee for the purposes of section 476 of ITEPA 2003 (whether or not anamount counts as employment income of the employee because of that event).\n\t\t\tSubsection (3) applies if the condition\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis not met, but\n\t\t\t\twould be met if at all material times the employee had been a UK employee.\n\t\t\tThis Chapter applies as if the employee had been a UK employee as mentionedin subsection (2)(b).\n\t\t\tThe employee is a UK employee if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe employee is UK resident and ordinarily UK resident, and\n\t\t\t\tthe duties of the relevant employment are performed in the United Kingdom.\n\t\t\tIf the employee is dead when the shares are acquired, the condition is tobe treated as met if it would have been met had the employee been alive.\n\tCalculation of amount of relief\n\t\tCalculation of relief if shares are neither restricted norconvertible\n\t\t\tIf the shares acquired are neither restricted shares nor convertibleshares, the amount of relief to be given is an amount equal to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe market value of the shares when they are acquired, less\n\t\t\t\tthe total amount or value of any consideration given by any person inrelation to the obtaining of the option or to the acquisition of the shares.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is subject to section 1020.\n\t\t\tThe consideration mentioned in subsection (1)(b) does not include\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe performance of any duties of, or in connection with, the relevantemployment, and\n\t\t\t\tan amount paid or payable by the employee because of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tan agreement within paragraph 3A(2) of Schedule 1 to the Social SecurityContributions and Benefits Act [1992 (c. 4)](/id/ukpga/1992/4?view=plain \"Goto item of legislation\") or of Schedule 1 to the Social Security Contributionsand Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act [1992 (c. 7)](/id/ukpga/1992/7?view=plain\"Go to item of legislation\"), or\n\t\t\t\tan election under paragraph 3B of either of those Schedules.\n\t\t\tA just and reasonable apportionment is to be made of any considerationgiven partly in relation to the obtaining of the option or the acquisition ofthe shares and partly in relation to other matters.\n\t\tCalculation of relief if shares are restricted or convertible\n\t\t\tIf the shares acquired are restricted shares or convertible shares (orboth), the amount of relief to be given is calculated as follows.\n\t\t\t\tThis is subject to section 1020.\n\t\t\tIf the shares are restricted shares, the amount of relief is equal to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe amount that counts as employment income of the employee under section476 of ITEPA 2003 in relation to the acquisition of the shares, or\n\t\t\t\tif the option is a qualifying option (within the meaning of the EMI code),the amount that would have so counted apart from the EMI code.\n\t\t\tIf the shares are convertible shares, the amount of relief is equal to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe amount that counts as employment income of the employee under section476 of ITEPA 2003 in relation to the acquisition of the shares, or\n\t\t\t\tif the option is a qualifying option (within the meaning of the EMI code),the amount that would have so counted apart from the EMI code;\n\t\t\t\tand in calculating the employee\u2019s employment income for this purpose themarket value of the shares is to be determined as if they were not convertibleshares.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsections (2) and (3)\u2014\n\t\t\t\tno account is to be taken of any relief under section 481 or 482 of ITEPA2003, and\n\t\t\t\t\u201cthe EMI code\u201d has the meaning given by section 527(3) of that Act.\n\t\t\tIf the shares are both restricted and convertible, the total amount ofrelief is whichever is the greater of the amounts of relief given bysubsections (2) and (3) (or, if the amount is the same in each case, thatamount).\n\t\t\tIf the employee is dead when the shares are acquired, the amount of reliefis to be calculated as if the employee were alive.\n\t\tReduction in amount of relief\n\t\t\tThis section applies if the relevant employment is in relation to both thequalifying business and a business (or part of a business) that is not withinsection 1015(2).\n\t\t\tThe amount of relief is to be reduced by a just and reasonable amount.\n\tGiving of relief\n\t\tHow the relief is given\n\t\t\tThe relief is given for the accounting period in which the shares areacquired.\n\t\t\tThe amount of relief is allowed as a deduction in calculating the profitsof the qualifying business for corporation tax purposes (subject tosubsections (3) and (4)).\n\t\t\tIf the employing company is a company with investment business (as definedin section 1218), the amount of relief is treated as expenses of management ofthe company.\n\t\t\t\tBut this subsection does not apply if the qualifying business is a propertybusiness (in which case subsection (2) applies instead).\n\t\t\tIf the employing company is a company in relation to which section 76 ofICTA (expenses of insurance companies) applies, the amount of relief istreated as expenses payable falling to be brought into account at Step 1 insubsection (7) of that section.\n\t\t\tIf the relevant employment is in relation to more than one business (orpart of a business) within section 1015(2), the relief is to be apportioned ona just and reasonable basis.\n\tTakeovers and transfers of businesses\n\t\tTakeover of company whose shares are subject to option\n\t\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta person (\u201cP\u201d) obtains a qualifying option to acquire shares in a company,\n\t\t\t\tsubsequently there is a takeover of that company,\n\t\t\t\tP, by agreement with the acquiring company, releases P\u2019s rights under thequalifying option in consideration of P\u2019s obtaining another option (\u201cthe newoption\u201d), and\n\t\t\t\tthe new option is an option to acquire shares in a qualifying company.\n\t\t\t\t\tSection 1023 explains what is meant by \u201cqualifying option\u201d, \u201ctakeover\u201d, \u201ctheacquiring company\u201d and \u201cqualifying company\u201d.\n\t\t\tThis Chapter applies as if shares acquired pursuant to the new option areacquired pursuant to the qualifying option.\n\t\t\tThe company whose shares are subject to the new option is a qualifyingsuccessor company for the purposes of paragraph (f) of condition 3 in section1016 (condition relating to shares acquired).\n\t\t\tIn calculating the amount of any relief resulting from this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\tany consideration given in relation to the obtaining of the new option istreated as consideration given in relation to the obtaining of the qualifyingoption, and\n\t\t\t\tany consideration given in relation to the acquisition of shares pursuantto the new option is treated as consideration given in relation to theacquisition of shares pursuant to the qualifying option.\n\t\t\t\tThe consideration covered by paragraph (a) does not include the considerationmentioned in subsection (1)(c).\n\t\tSupplementary provision for purposes of section 1022\n\t\t\tThis section applies for the purposes of section 1022.\n\t\t\tAn option is a qualifying option if condition 3 in section 1016 would bemet in relation to shares acquired pursuant to the option.\n\t\t\tThere is a takeover of a company when another company (\u201cthe acquiringcompany\u201d) acquires control of it.\n\t\t\tThe following companies are qualifying companies\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe acquiring company,\n\t\t\t\ta company that, when the takeover occurs, is a parent company of theacquiring company,\n\t\t\t\ta company that, when the takeover occurs, is a member of a consortium thatowns the acquiring company,\n\t\t\t\ta company that, when the takeover occurs, is a member of a consortium thatowns a parent company of the acquiring company, and\n\t\t\t\ta

company is amember of a consortium that owns another company (\u201ccompany B\u201d), and\n\t\t\t\tcompany A is\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta member of that consortium or a parent company of a member of thatconsortium, and\n\t\t\t\ta member of the same commercial association of companies as company B.\n\t\tTransfer of qualifying business by group transfers\n\t\t\tThis section applies in relation to relief to be given under this Chapterif\u2014\n\t\t\t\tduring the option period, the whole, or substantially the whole, of thequalifying business is transferred, and\n\t\t\t\tconditions A and B are met.\n\t\t\tCondition A is that\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe transfer is a group transfer, or\n\t\t\t\tif there is more than one transfer, all the transfers are group transfers.\n\t\t\tCondition B is that, as a result of the transfer or transfers, at the endof the option period\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe whole, or substantially the whole, of the qualifying business iscarried on by one company (\u201cthe successor

artificiallyinflated claims and confidentiality of information.\n\t\t\tIn this Chapter \u201cthe separate film trade\u201d means the company\u2019s separatetrade in relation to the film (see section 1188).\n\t\t\tSee Schedule 18 to FA 1998 (in particular, Part 9D) for information aboutthe procedure for making claims for film tax relief.\n\tConditions of relief\n\t\tIntended theatrical

and\n\t\t\t\ta film is not regarded as intended for theatrical release unless it isintended that a significant proportion of the earnings from the film should beobtained by such exhibition.\n\t\t\tWhether this condition is met is determined for each accounting period ofthe company during which film-making activities are carried on in relation tothe film, in accordance with the following rules.\n\t\t\tIf at the end of an accounting period the film is intended for theatricalrelease, the condition is treated as having been met throughout that period(subject to subsection

accounting period,\n\t\t\t\tthe expenses of management are apportioned between any accounting periods thatfall within the period of account (and are referable to accounting periods sofar as they are apportioned to them).\n\t\t\tAn apportionment under subsection (2) must be made in accordance withsection 1311 (time basis) or, if it appears that that method would workunreasonably or unjustly, on a

accounting period to whichthey would have been referable under section 1225(1) or (2) if they had beendebited in those accounts in accordance with generally accepted accountingpractice.\n\t\tAccounts not drawn up\n\t\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\t\ta company does not draw up accounts, or does not draw them up for aparticular period, and\n\t\t\t\tas a result, expenses of management are not referable to an accountingperiod under section 1225 or 1226,\n\t\t\t\t\ttake the following steps to determine the accounting period to which they arereferable.\n\t\t\tThe steps are\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * _Step 1_\n\t\t\tAssume that for each accounting period of the company that does not coincidewith, or fall within, any period of account there is a period of account thatcoincides with it.\n\t\t\t\t  * _Step 2_\n\t\t\tIf it would be in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting practice todebit the expenses of management, or any part of them, in accounts drawn up bythe company for that deemed period

purposes of sections 1229 and 1230, a credit reverses the whole orpart of a debit in any case where the credit falls to be made because\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe sum represented in whole or in part by the debit is paid and thenwholly or partly repaid, or\n\t\t\t\tthe sum represented by the debit is never paid.\n\t\tClaw back of relief\n\t\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta credit is brought into account by a company in a period of account (\u201ctheperiod of the credit\u201d),\n\t\t\t\tthe credit reverses (in whole or in part) a debit brought into account in aprevious period of account of the company,\n\t\t\t\tthe debit (or part of it) represents expenses of management deductibleunder section 1219 for an accounting period which ends before, or at the sametime as, the period of the credit, and\n\t\t\t\tthe expenses of management are not expenses brought forward to that periodunder section 1223.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor cases involving an absence of accounts see also section 1231.\n\t\t\tThe reversal amount (see section 1230) is dealt with in accordance withsubsection (3) or (5).\n\t\t\tIf the period of the credit coincides with an accounting period of thecompany\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe reversal amount is, as far as possible, applied in reducing (but notbelow nil) the company\u2019s expenses of management belonging to that period, and\n\t\t\t\tif not all of the amount can be applied in that way, the remainder is to betreated as a receipt of the company chargeable for that period under thecharge to corporation tax on income.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (3), the expenses of management belonging toa period are the expenses of management that are deductible for that period,excluding any amounts brought forward under section 1223.\n\t\t\tIf the period of the credit does not coincide with an accounting period ofthe company\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe reversal amount is apportioned between any accounting periods that fallwithin the period of the credit, and\n\t\t\t\tparagraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (3) are applied to any amount that isapportioned to an accounting period.\n\t\t\tAn apportionment under subsection (5) must be made in accordance withsection 1311 (time basis) or, if it appears that that method would workunreasonably or unjustly, on a just and reasonable basis.\n\t\tMeaning of \u201creversal amount\u201d\n\t\t\tThis section gives the meaning of \u201creversal amount\u201d for the purposes ofthis Part.\n\t\t\tIf a credit reverses the whole or part of a debit, the reversal amount isfound as follows.\n\t\t\t\t  * _Step 1_\n\t\t\t\tTake however much of the credit reverses the debit.\n\t\t\t\t  * _Step 2_\n\t\t\tReduce that (if applicable) to however much of the credit reverses the part ofthe debit that represents expenses of management deductible under section1219.\n\t\t\t\t  * _Step 3_\n\t\t\tReduce that (if applicable) to exclude any part of the credit that representssums otherwise taken into account in calculating for corporation tax purposesthe profits and losses of the company for the relevant accounting period or anearlier accounting period.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201crelevant accounting period\u201d means the latest accountingperiod of the company that falls wholly or partly within the period of thecredit (see section 1229(1)(a)).\n\t\tAbsence of accounts\n\t\t\tThis section sets out how section 1229 operates if a company has anaccounting period that neither coincides with nor falls within any period ofaccount.\n\t\t\tSection 1229 operates as if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthere were a period of account of the company that coincides with thataccounting period, and\n\t\t\t\tin calculating for accounting purposes the company\u2019s profits and losses forthat period of account, amounts were brought into account in accordance withUK generally accepted accounting practice.\n\t\t\tThe references in section 1251(3)(b) (car or motor cycle hire) to

accounting period of a firm which carries ona trade are to a period that would be an accounting period of the firm if thefirm were a company.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (1) it is to be

expenses\u201d includes any expenses of a scheme manager (other than the provision of benefits to employees of the employer)\u2014 \n\t\t\twhich are incurred in operating the employee benefit scheme, and\n\t\t\twhich, if incurred by the employer, would be deductible in calculating forcorporation tax purposes the employer\u2019s profits of any period of account, and\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cscheme

a reference to an amount being brought into account under section 76of ICTA as expenses payable, and\n\t\t\treferences to deduction are to be read in that light."
