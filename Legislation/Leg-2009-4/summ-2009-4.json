This implies that the farmer cannot claim a deduction for the cost of purchasing the herd or the increase in the herd's value over time.\n* Addition of Animals to Herd: When adding animals to the herd, no deduction is allowed for the cost of the animals. Instead, the value of the additional animals is brought into account as a receipt.\n* Replacement of Animals in Herd: When replacing animals in the herd, the sale proceeds of the old animal are brought into account as a receipt, and a deduction is allowed for the cost of the new animal. However, if the new animal is of worse quality than the old animal, the amount of the receipt and the deduction must be adjusted accordingly.\n* Sale of Animals From Herd: If the farmer sells animals from the herd, the profit arising from the sale is brought into account as a receipt, and a deduction is allowed for any loss arising from the sale.\n* Sale of Whole or Substantial Part of Herd: If the farmer sells the entire or a significant portion of the herd, no profit is recognized as a receipt, and no deduction is allowed for any loss. Instead, the sale proceeds are deemed to be a disposal of the assets of the trade, and the farmer may need to report the gain or loss on the disposal on their tax return.\n* Acquisition of New Herd Begun Within 5 Years of Sale: If the farmer acquires a new herd within five years of selling the previous herd, certain provisions apply to the calculation of profits. Specifically, the sale proceeds of the old animals are not brought into account as a receipt until the new animals are acquired.\n* Section 118: Sale for Reasons Outside Farmer's Control: If the farmer sells the herd due to reasons beyond their control, such as disease control orders or natural disasters, the sale proceeds are not brought into account as a receipt, and the farmer may be eligible for relief or compensation.\n* Section 120: Sale for Reasons Outside Farmer's Control: If the farmer sells a substantial part of the herd due to reasons beyond their control, such as disease control orders or natural disasters, the sale proceeds are not brought into account as a receipt, and the farmer may be eligible for relief or compensation."
