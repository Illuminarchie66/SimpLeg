secondary Class 1 contribution is payable as mentioned in section 6(1)(b)of the 1992 Act in respect of earnings paid in a tax week in respect of anemployed earner\u2019s employment by an employer other than a public authority,\n\t\t\t\tthe freeport conditions are met in relation to the contribution (seesection 2), and\n\t\t\t\tthe employer (or, if different, the secondary contributor) elects that thissection is to apply in relation to the contribution for the purposes ofsection 9(1) of the 1992 Act instead of section 9(1A) of that Act or section 6of this Act.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of section 9(1) of the 1992 Act\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe relevant percentage in respect of any earnings paid in the tax week upto or at the upper secondary threshold is 0%, and\n\t\t\t\tthe relevant percentage in respect of any earnings paid in the tax weekabove that threshold is the secondary percentage.\n\t\t\tThe upper secondary threshold (or the prescribed equivalent in relation toearners paid otherwise than weekly) is the amount specified in, or inregulations under, section 8.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of the 1992 Act a person is still to be regarded as beingliable to pay a secondary Class 1 contribution even if the amount of thecontribution is \u00a30 as a result of this section.\n\t\t\tThe Treasury may by regulations make provision about cases in which thissection is to be treated as applying in relation to contributions payable inrespect of a tax week in a given tax year only when\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat tax year has ended, and\n\t\t\t\tall contributions payable in respect of a tax week in that tax year havebeen paid.\n\t\t\tRegulations under subsection (5) may modify the freeport conditions insection 2(1)(c) and (d) for the purposes of cases to which the regulationsapply.\n\t\tFreeport conditions\n\t\t\tThe freeport conditions are that\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe employed earner\u2019s employment is a new employment that\u2014\n\t\t\t\tbegins on or after 6 April 2022, but\n\t\t\t\tdoes not begin later than 5 April 2026,\n\t\t\t\tthe earnings\u2014\n\t\t\t\tare paid during the period of three years beginning with the first day ofthe employment, but\n\t\t\t\tare not paid after the relevant end date (see subsection (6)),\n\t\t\t\tthe contribution is paid in respect of earnings paid in a tax week all ofwhich is in a qualifying period of the employment, and\n\t\t\t\tat the time the qualifying period begins, the employer reasonably expectsthat 60% or more of the earner\u2019s employed time during that period will bespent in a single freeport tax site in which the employer has businesspremises.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (1)(a), an employment is new if the earnerwas not employed by the employer or by a person connected with the employer(within the meaning of section 993 of the Income Tax Act 2007) at any timewithin the period of two years ending with the day on which the employmentbegins.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (1)(c) a qualifying period of the employmentis a period\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat begins with\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe start of the employment, or\n\t\t\t\ta substantial change in the earner\u2019s working arrangements, and\n\t\t\t\tthat ends (subject to subsection (4)(d)) with\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe end of the employment,\n\t\t\t\tthe relevant end date, or\n\t\t\t\ta substantial change in the earner\u2019s working arrangements.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (1)(d)\u2014\n\t\t\t\tan earner\u2019s employed time is time when the earner is expected to provideservices to the employer under the terms of a contract of service (\u201cworkingtime\u201d), together with time when the earner would have provided such servicesbut for being on leave (of any sort);\n\t\t\t\tit is to be assumed that the proportion of the time when an earner is onleave that is spent at any given freeport tax site is the same as theproportion of the earner\u2019s working time that would be spent at that site ifthe earner were not on leave;\n\t\t\t\tit does not matter whether the earner is expected to provide services undera single contract of service or under successive contracts of service,provided that the employment does not cease;\n\t\t\t\tif an expectation for the purposes of subsection (1)(d) ceases to bereasonable in any given tax week, the condition in that subsection ceases tobe met, and the qualifying period is taken to end, at the end of the previoustax week.\n\t\t\tIf the secondary contributor in relation to the earner is not the earner\u2019semployer\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsubsection (1)(d) has effect as if both references to \u201cthe employer\u201d werereferences to \u201cthe secondary contributor\u201d, and\n\t\t\t\tsubsection (2) has effect as if, after both references to \u201cthe employer\u201d,there were inserted \u201cor the secondary contributor\u201d.\n\t\t\tThe relevant end date is the earlier of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe last day of the period of three years beginning with the day after theday for the time being specified in subsection (1)(a)(ii), and\n\t\t\t\t5 April 2031.\n\t\tFreeport conditions: supplementary\n\t\t\tThe Treasury may by regulations made before the end of the day for the timebeing specified in section 2(1)(a)(ii) amend that subsection to substitute forthat day any other day up to and including 5 April 2031.\n\t\t\tThe Treasury may by regulations provide for circumstances in which afreeport condition is to be treated as being met.\n\t\t\tThe Treasury may by regulations make such other changes in relation to thefreeport conditions as they consider appropriate (including by adding,removing or altering conditions).\n\t\t\tRegulations under subsection (3) may, among other things\u2014\n\t\t\t\tprovide for circumstances in which a condition is to be treated as notbeing met;\n\t\t\t\tadd conditions relating to accounts or other records;\n\t\t\t\tadd conditions requiring a person to take steps specified in theregulations.\n\t\t\tRegulations under subsection (2) or (3) may make provision by reference tosectors of the economy or to descriptions of employer, earner or employment.\n\t\t\tRegulations under subsection (2) or (3) may amend, repeal or otherwisemodify this Part.\n\t\tAnti-avoidance \n\t\t\tSection 1 does not apply if it would otherwise apply only as a result ofavoidance arrangements.\n\t\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201carrangements\u201d include any scheme, transaction or series of transactions, agreement or understanding, whether or not legally enforceable; \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cavoidance arrangements\u201d means any arrangements which it is reasonable in all the circumstances\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tto conclude are, or include steps that

section or in provision made inor under sections 2 and 3.\n\t\tZero-rate contributions for employees at freeport tax sites: NorthernIreland\n\t\t\tThe Treasury may by regulations make provision corresponding or similar toprovision made in, under or for the purposes of sections 1 to 4 in relation toNorthern Ireland.\n\tVeterans\n\t\tZero-rate contributions for armed forces veterans\n\t\t\tSubsection (2) applies where\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta secondary Class 1 contribution is payable as mentioned in section 6(1)(b)of either of the 1992 Acts in respect of earnings paid in a tax week inrespect of an employment,\n\t\t\t\tthe tax week is in a tax year mentioned in subsection (4),\n\t\t\t\tthe veteran conditions are met in relation to the contribution (see section7), and\n\t\t\t\tthe employer (or, if different, the secondary contributor) elects thatsubsection (2) is to apply in relation to the contribution for the purposes ofsection 9(1) of whichever of the 1992 Acts would otherwise apply instead ofsection 9(1A) of that Act or section 1 of this Act.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of section 9(1) of whichever of the 1992 Acts wouldotherwise apply\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe relevant percentage in respect of any earnings paid in the tax week upto or at the upper secondary threshold is 0%, and\n\t\t\t\tthe relevant percentage in respect of any earnings paid in the tax weekabove that threshold is the secondary percentage.\n\t\t\tThe upper secondary threshold (or the prescribed equivalent in relation toearners paid otherwise than weekly) is the amount specified in, or inregulations under, section 8.\n\t\t\tThe tax years are\u2014\n\t\t\t\t2022-23; \n\t\t\t\t2023-24. \n\t\t\tAny amount paid by way of secondary Class 1 contribution in relation to atax week in the tax year 2021-22 that would not have been payable if that taxyear had been mentioned in subsection (4) and an election had been made forthe purposes of subsection (1)(d) in relation to the contribution is to betreated, from 6 April 2022, as not having been payable.\n\t\t\tThe Treasury may by regulations made before the end of the last tax yearfor the time being mentioned in subsection (4) (\u201cthe last tax year\u201d) amendthat subsection so as to add one or more consecutive tax years followingimmediately after the last tax year.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of the 1992 Acts a person is still to be regarded as beingliable to pay a secondary Class 1 contribution even if the amount of thecontribution is \u00a30 as a result of this section.\n\t\t\tThe Treasury may by regulations make provision about cases in whichsubsection (2) is to be treated as applying in relation to contributionspayable in respect of a tax week in a given tax year only when\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat tax year has ended, and\n\t\t\t\tall contributions payable in respect of a tax week in that tax year havebeen paid.\n\t\tVeteran conditions\n\t\t\tThe veteran conditions are that\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe earner has served for at least one day as a member of any of theregular forces,\n\t\t\t\tthe employment is employment in a civilian capacity, and\n\t\t\t\tthe earnings are paid during the period of one year beginning with theearner\u2019s first day of employment in a civilian capacity since the earner lastceased to be a member of any of the regular forces.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (1)(c), it is immaterial if the earner\u2019sfirst day of employment in a civilian capacity was before the start of the taxyear 2022-23 (or, in a case where section 6(5) applies, the tax year 2021-22).\n\tUpper
