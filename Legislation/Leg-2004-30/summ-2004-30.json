    "summary": "The Human Tissue Act of 2004 regulates the use of human tissue for scientific research, ensuring that individuals providing the tissue have given their consent. Researchers must follow strict rules regarding how the tissue can be used and stored, and must obtain ethical approval for their projects. The act also covers the importation and exportation of human tissues, and sets penalties for violations. Additionally, the act allows certain activities related to human tissues, such as using them for medical devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices, to be exempt from the requirements of the act. The act also defines key terms related to the handling and use of human tissue for anatomical examination, and specifies the appeals process for any decisions related to these licenses. Overall, the act aims to protect the rights of individuals who provide human tissue for scientific research, while also promoting the advancement of medical knowledge and technology."
