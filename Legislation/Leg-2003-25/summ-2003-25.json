The commission will have powers to investigate certain issues and make recommendations to improve the political situation in the region. Additionally, the act makes provisions for reducing the salaries of members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and limits the amount of financial assistance given to political parties in the region. It also allows for \"censure resolutions\" to be passed by the assembly, which can express disapproval of the government's actions. Overall, the goal of the act is to promote stability and good governance in Northern Ireland.",
