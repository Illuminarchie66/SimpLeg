    "general": "This law helps British Energy, a company that makes electricity, get money from the government so they can keep running their business. It also changes some rules about how electricity is made and sold. The law says that if British Energy gives money to other companies, those companies don't have to pay taxes on that money. This will help British Energy stay in business and keep making electricity for people to use.",
