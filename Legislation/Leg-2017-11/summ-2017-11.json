    "summary": "The Parking Places (Variation of Charges) Act 2017 lets local councils change the fees they charge for parking in car parks and designated parking spots. This means that if you park your car in a council-run car park or a designated parking spot, the council can raise or lower the fee you pay to park there.\nBefore making any changes, the council must now talk to the public and listen to their ideas. This guarantees that everyone has a voice in any modifications that might be made.\nAdditionally, the law enables local governments to set various prices for various uses when establishing costs. For instance, a town may decide to charge more for parking in a busy area than in a less crowded one.\nThis law only applies to England and Wales, and only the parts added by sections 1 and 2 apply to rules established by the Secretary of State. So, if you live in Scotland or Northern Ireland, this law won't have an impact on you.\nOverall, the Parking Places (Variation of Charges) Act 2017 aims to give locals a greater voice in how much they pay to park in council-run car parks and designated parking areas.",
