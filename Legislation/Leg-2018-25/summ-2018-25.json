    "general": "This law makes it easier for people who own multiple properties next to each other to only pay one set of property taxes on all of them if they are connected by a shared wall or fence. It also allows local governments in England to raise the amount of tax paid on vacant homes that have been empty for a long time. This helps councils collect more money from landlords who leave their properties unoccupied for years without paying any taxes.",

For financial years beginning on or after 1 April 2021, the higher amount is determined based on the length of time the dwelling has been empty, with a maximum increase of 300%.\n* Simplified point 3: The act applies to England and Wales, and defines \"financial year\" as a period of 12 months beginning with 1 April."

    "summary": "The Rating (Property in Common Occupation) and Council Tax (Empty Dwellings) Act 2018 changes the way properties are rated for non-domestic purposes in England. If you own or occupy multiple properties next to each other, these can now be considered as one property for rating purposes. Additionally, if you have an empty property in England for a long time, you might pay more council tax. The law only applies to England and Wales, and uses a 12-month period called a \"financial year\" that starts on April 1st.\nIn simpler terms, the law helps simplify the rating system for properties in England by allowing connected properties to be treated as one. It also increases the council tax paid on empty properties for longer periods of time, up to a maximum of 300% more.",
