    "general": "This law helps people who have done crimes to become better and not do them again. It makes sure they are released from prison at the right time and are watched over by authorities so they don't commit more crimes. It also gives judges more power to give community service or suspend sentences instead of jail time, which can help offenders change their behavior and reintegrate into society. The goal is to reduce crime and make communities safer.",
