    "summary": "The Emergency Workers (Obstruction) Act 2006 makes it against the law to stop or slow down people providing emergency services like firefighters, ambulance crews, and coast guards when they're dealing with emergencies such as fires, accidents, or sicknesses. This means that if you purposely get in their way or slow them down without a good reason, you could face a fine of up to \u00a35,000 and potentially go to jail. Additionally, the government has the power to change the law to add or take away certain groups of people from the list of those protected by the law. So, always remember to move out of the way and let these brave individuals do their jobs so they can keep us safe!",
