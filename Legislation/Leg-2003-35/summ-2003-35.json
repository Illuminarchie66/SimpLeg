    "summary": "The European Union (Accessions) Act 2003 helps Eastern European countries join the European Union (EU). This law lets workers from these countries move freely to the UK to work, as long as they follow certain rules and regulations. The government can make laws to carry out the treaty, but they need approval from Parliament first. These laws can be made quickly if there is an emergency. The law also explains important terms like \"EEA State\" and \"relevant acceding state\". Overall, this act helps open up new opportunities for workers and businesses in both the UK and Eastern Europe.",
