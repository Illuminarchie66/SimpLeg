    "general": "This law changes how telecom companies can use leased properties like buildings or land to install communication equipment like cell phone towers or fiber optic cables. Before, these companies had to follow strict rules when using these properties. Now, they have more freedom to do so as long as they follow some basic guidelines. This should make it easier for them to provide better internet and phone service to people all over the UK.",

    "summary": "The UK government has created a new law called the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Act 2021 to help telecom companies install and maintain electronic communication networks in rental properties more easily. Under this law, telecom companies can get permission from property owners to place equipment like cell towers or fiber optic cables on their land without having to go to court first. If the owner doesn't respond within a certain time frame, the company can start work anyway. The law also says that the company must pay fair compensation to the owner if they cause any damage or loss. Additionally, the law sets up rules for how these agreements between telecom companies and property owners should be written and enforced."
