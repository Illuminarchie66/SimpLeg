under a services contract arenot met?\n\t\tConsumer\u2019s rights to enforce terms about services\n\t\t\tThe consumer\u2019s rights under this section and sections 55 and 56 do notaffect any rights that the contract provides for, if those are notinconsistent.\n\t\t\tIn this section and section 55 a reference to a service conforming to acontract is a reference to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe service being performed in accordance with section 49, or\n\t\t\t\tthe service conforming to a term that section 50 requires to be treated asincluded in the contract and that relates to the performance of the service.\n\t\t\tIf the service does not conform to the contract, the consumer\u2019s rights (andthe provisions about them and when they are available) are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe right to require repeat performance (see section 55);\n\t\t\t\tthe right to a price reduction (see section 56).\n\t\t\tIf the trader is in breach of a term that section 50 requires to be treatedas included in the contract

what the contract requires under section 52(performance within a reasonable time), the consumer has the right to a pricereduction (see section 56 for provisions about that right and when it isavailable).\n\t\t\tThis section and sections 55 and 56 do not prevent the consumer seekingother remedies for a breach of a term to which any of subsections (3) to (5)applies, instead of or in addition to a remedy referred to there (but not soas to recover twice for the same loss).\n\t\t\tThose other remedies include any of the following that is open to theconsumer in the circumstances\u2014\n\t\t\t\tclaiming damages;\n\t\t\t\tseeking to recover money paid where the consideration for payment of themoney has failed;\n\t\t\t\tseeking specific

an end.\n\t\tRight to repeat performance\n\t\t\tThe right to require repeat performance is a right to require the trader toperform the service again, to the extent necessary to complete its performancein conformity with the contract.\n\t\t\tIf the consumer requires such repeat performance, the trader\u2014\n\t\t\t\tmust provide it within a reasonable time and without significantinconvenience to the consumer; and\n\t\t\t\tmust bear any necessary costs incurred in doing so (including in particularthe cost of any labour or materials).\n\t\t\tThe consumer cannot require repeat performance if completing performance ofthe service in conformity with the contract is impossible.\n\t\t\tAny question as to what is a reasonable time or significant inconvenienceis to be determined taking account of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe nature of the service, and\n\t\t\t\tthe purpose for which the service was to be performed.\n\t\tRight to price reduction\n\t\t\tThe right to a price reduction is the right to require the trader to reducethe price to the consumer by an appropriate amount (including the right toreceive a refund for anything already paid above the reduced amount).\n\t\t\tThe amount of the reduction may, where appropriate, be the full amount ofthe price.\n\t\t\tA consumer who has that right and the right to require repeat performanceis only entitled to a price reduction in one of these situations\u2014\n\t\t\t\tbecause of section 55(3) the consumer cannot require repeat performance; or\n\t\t\t\tthe consumer has required repeat performance, but the trader is in breachof the requirement of section 55(2)(a) to do it within a reasonable time andwithout significant inconvenience to the consumer.\n\t\t\tA refund under this section must be given without undue delay, and in anyevent within 14 days beginning with the day on which the trader agrees thatthe consumer is entitled to a refund.\n\t\t\tThe trader must give the refund using the same means of payment as theconsumer used to pay for the service, unless the consumer expressly agreesotherwise.\n\t\t\tThe trader must not impose any fee on the consumer in respect of therefund.\n\tCan a trader contract out of statutory rights and remedies under aservices contract?\n\t\tLiability that cannot be excluded or restricted\n\t\t\tA term of a contract to supply services is not binding on the consumer tothe extent that it would exclude the trader\u2019s liability arising under section49 (service to be performed with reasonable care and skill).\n\t\t\tSubject to section 50(2), a term of a contract to supply services is notbinding on the consumer to the extent that it would exclude the trader\u2019sliability arising under section 50 (information about trader or service to bebinding).\n\t\t\tA term of a contract to supply services is not binding on the consumer tothe extent that it would restrict the trader\u2019s liability arising under any ofsections 49 and 50 and, where they apply, sections 51 and 52 (reasonable priceand reasonable time), if it would prevent the consumer in an appropriate casefrom recovering the price paid or the value of any other consideration. (If itwould not prevent the consumer from doing so, Part 2 (unfair terms) mayapply.)\n\t\t\tThat also means that a term of a contract to supply services is not bindingon the consumer to the extent that it would \u2014\n\t\t\t\texclude or restrict a right or remedy in respect of a liability under anyof sections 49 to 52,\n\t\t\t\tmake such a right or remedy or its enforcement subject to a restrictive oronerous condition,\n\t\t\t\tallow a trader to put a person at a disadvantage as a result of pursuingsuch a right or remedy, or\n\t\t\t\texclude or restrict rules of evidence or procedure.\n\t\t\tThe references in subsections (1) to (3) to excluding or restricting aliability also include preventing an obligation or duty arising or limitingits extent.\n\t\t\tAn agreement in writing to submit present or future differences toarbitration is not to be regarded as excluding or restricting any liabilityfor the purposes of this section.\n\t\t\tSee Schedule 3 for provision about the enforcement of this section."

and a consumer.\n\t\t\tThis does not include a contract of employment or apprenticeship.\n\t\t\tA contract to which this Part applies is referred to in this Part as a\u201cconsumer contract\u201d.\n\t\t\tThis Part applies to a notice to the extent that it\u2014\n\t\t\t\trelates to rights or obligations as between a trader and a consumer, or\n\t\t\t\tpurports to exclude or restrict a trader\u2019s liability to a consumer.\n\t\t\tThis does not include a notice relating to rights, obligations orliabilities as between an employer and an employee.\n\t\t\tIt does not matter for the purposes of subsection (4) whether the notice isexpressed to apply to a consumer, as long as it is reasonable to assume it isintended to be seen or heard by a consumer.\n\t\t\tA notice to which this Part applies is referred to in this Part as a\u201cconsumer notice\u201d.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201cnotice\u201d includes an announcement, whether or not inwriting, and any other communication or purported communication.\n\tWhat are the general rules about fairness of contract terms and notices?\n\t\tRequirement for contract terms and notices to be fair\n\t\t\tAn unfair term of a consumer contract is not binding on the consumer.\n\t\t\tAn unfair consumer notice is not binding on the consumer.\n\t\t\tThis does not prevent the consumer from relying on the term or notice ifthe consumer chooses to do so.\n\t\t\tA term is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes asignificant imbalance in the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under thecontract to the detriment of the consumer.\n\t\t\tWhether a term is fair is to be determined\u2014\n\t\t\t\ttaking into account the nature of the subject matter of the contract, and\n\t\t\t\tby reference to all the circumstances existing when the term was agreed andto all of the other terms of the contract or of any other contract on which itdepends.\n\t\t\tA notice is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causesa significant imbalance in the parties\u2019 rights and obligations to thedetriment of the consumer.\n\t\t\tWhether a notice is fair is to be determined\u2014\n\t\t\t\ttaking into account the nature of the subject matter of the notice, and\n\t\t\t\tby reference to all the circumstances existing when the rights orobligations to which it relates arose and to the terms of any contract onwhich it depends.\n\t\t\tThis section does not affect the operation of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsection 31 (exclusion of liability: goods contracts),\n\t\t\t\tsection 47 (exclusion of liability: digital content contracts),\n\t\t\t\tsection 57 (exclusion of liability: services contracts), or\n\t\t\t\tsection 65 (exclusion of negligence liability).\n\t\tContract terms which may or must be regarded as unfair\n\t\t\tPart 1 of Schedule 2 contains an indicative and non-exhaustive list ofterms of consumer contracts that may be regarded as unfair for the purposes ofthis Part.\n\t\t\tPart 1 of Schedule 2 is subject to Part 2 of that Schedule; but a termlisted in Part 2 of that Schedule may nevertheless be assessed for fairnessunder section 62 unless section 64 or 73 applies to it.\n\t\t\tThe Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument amendSchedule 2 so as to add, modify or remove an entry in Part 1 or Part 2 of thatSchedule.\n\t\t\tAn order under subsection (3) may contain transitional or transitoryprovision or savings.\n\t\t\tNo order may be made under subsection (3) unless a draft of the statutoryinstrument containing it has been laid before, and approved by a resolutionof, each House of Parliament.\n\t\t\tA term of a consumer contract must be regarded as unfair if it has theeffect that the consumer bears the burden of proof with respect to complianceby a distance supplier or an intermediary with an obligation under anyenactment or rule implementing the Distance Marketing Directive.\n\t\t\tIn subsection (6)\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cthe Distance Marketing Directive\u201d means Directive [2002/65/EC](/european/directive/2002/0065?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\")

main subject matter of the contract, or\n\t\t\t\tthe assessment is of the appropriateness of the price payable under thecontract by comparison with the goods, digital content or services suppliedunder it.\n\t\t\tSubsection (1) excludes a term from an assessment under section 62 only ifit is transparent and prominent.\n\t\t\tA term is transparent for the purposes of this Part if it is expressed inplain and intelligible language and (in the case of a written term) islegible.\n\t\t\tA term is prominent for the purposes of this section if it is brought tothe consumer\u2019s attention in such a way that an average consumer would be awareof the term.\n\t\t\tIn subsection (4) \u201caverage consumer\u201d means a consumer who is reasonablywell-informed, observant and circumspect.\n\t\t\tThis section does not apply to a term of a contract listed in Part 1 ofSchedule 2.\n\t\tBar on exclusion or restriction of negligence liability\n\t\t\tA trader cannot by a term of a consumer contract or by a consumer noticeexclude or restrict liability for death or personal injury resulting fromnegligence.\n\t\t\tWhere a term of a consumer contract, or a consumer notice, purports toexclude or restrict a trader\u2019s liability for negligence, a person is not to betaken to have voluntarily accepted any risk merely because the person agreedto or knew about the term or notice.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201cpersonal injury\u201d includes any disease and any impairmentof physical or mental condition.\n\t\t\tIn this section \u201cnegligence\u201d means the breach of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tany obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill in theperformance of a contract where the obligation arises from an express orimplied term of the contract,\n\t\t\t\ta common law duty to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill,\n\t\t\t\tthe common duty of care imposed by the Occupiers\u2019 Liability Act 1957 or theOccupiers\u2019 Liability Act (Northern Ireland) 1957, or\n\t\t\t\tthe duty of reasonable care imposed by section 2(1) of the Occupiers\u2019Liability (Scotland) Act 1960.\n\t\t\tIt is immaterial for the purposes of subsection (4)\u2014\n\t\t\t\twhether a breach of duty or obligation was inadvertent or intentional, or\n\t\t\t\twhether liability for it arises directly or vicariously.\n\t\t\tThis section is subject to section 66 (which makes provision about thescope of this section).\n\t\tScope of section 65\n\t\t\tSection 65 does not apply to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tany contract so far as it is a contract of insurance, including a contractto pay an annuity on human life, or\n\t\t\t\tany contract so far as it relates to the creation or transfer of aninterest in land.\n\t\t\tSection 65 does not affect the validity of any discharge or indemnity givenby a person in consideration of the receipt by that person of compensation insettlement of any claim the person has.\n\t\t\tSection 65 does not\u2014\n\t\t\t\tapply to liability which is excluded or discharged as mentioned in section4(2)(a) (exception to liability to pay damages to relatives) of the Damages(Scotland) Act 2011, or\n\t\t\t\taffect the operation of section 5 (discharge of liability to pay damages:exception for mesothelioma) of that Act.\n\t\t\tSection 65 does not apply to the liability of an occupier of premises to aperson who obtains access to the premises for recreational purposes if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe person suffers loss or damage because of the dangerous state of thepremises, and\n\t\t\t\tallowing the person access for those purposes is not within the purposes ofthe occupier\u2019s trade, business, craft or profession.\n\t\tEffect of an unfair term on the rest of a contract\n\t\t\tWhere a term of a consumer contract is not binding on the consumer as a resultof this Part, the contract continues, so far as practicable, to have effect inevery other respect.\n\t\tRequirement for transparency\n\t\t\tA trader must ensure that a written term of a consumer contract, or aconsumer notice in writing, is transparent.\n\t\t\tA consumer notice is transparent for the purposes of subsection (1) if itis expressed in plain and intelligible language and it is legible.\n\t\tContract terms that may have different meanings\n\t\t\tIf a term in a consumer contract, or a consumer notice, could havedifferent meanings, the meaning that is most favourable to the consumer is toprevail.\n\t\t\tSubsection (1) does not apply to the construction of a term or a notice inproceedings on an application for an injunction or interdict under paragraph 3of Schedule 3.\n\tHow are the general rules enforced?\n\t\tEnforcement of the law on unfair contract terms\n\t\t\tSchedule 3 confers functions on the Competition and Markets Authority andother regulators in relation to the enforcement of this Part.\n\t\t\tFor provision about the investigatory powers that are available to thoseregulators for the purposes of that Schedule, see Schedule 5.\n\tSupplementary provisions\n\t\tDuty of court to consider fairness of term\n\t\t\tSubsection (2) applies to proceedings before a court which relate to a termof a consumer contract.\n\t\t\tThe court must consider whether the term is fair even if none of theparties to the proceedings has raised that issue or indicated that it intendsto raise it.\n\t\t\tBut subsection (2) does not apply unless the court considers that it hasbefore it sufficient legal and factual material to enable it to consider thefairness of the term.\n\t\tApplication of rules to secondary contracts\n\t\t\tThis section applies if a term of a contract (\u201cthe secondary contract\u201d)reduces the rights or remedies or increases the obligations of a person underanother contract (\u201cthe main contract\u201d).\n\t\t\tThe term is subject to the provisions of this Part that would apply to theterm if it were in the main contract.\n\t\t\tIt does not matter for the purposes of this section\u2014\n\t\t\t\twhether the parties to the secondary contract are the same as the partiesto the main contract, or\n\t\t\t\twhether the secondary contract is a consumer contract.\n\t\t\tThis section does not apply if the secondary contract is a settlement of aclaim arising under the main contract.\n\t\tDisapplication of rules to mandatory terms and notices\n\t\t\tThis Part does not apply to a term of a contract, or to a notice, to theextent that it reflects\u2014\n\t\t\t\tmandatory statutory or regulatory provisions, or\n\t\t\t\tthe provisions or principles of an international convention to which theUnited Kingdom or the EU is a party.\n\t\t\tIn subsection (1) \u201cmandatory statutory or regulatory provisions\u201d includesrules which, according to law, apply between the parties on the basis that noother arrangements have been established.\n\t\tContracts applying law of non-EEA State\n\t\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tthe law of a country or territory other than an EEA State is chosen by theparties to be applicable to a consumer contract, but\n\t\t\t\tthe consumer contract has a close connection with the United Kingdom,\n\t\t\t\t\tthis Part applies despite that choice.\n\t\t\tFor cases where the law applicable has not been chosen or the law of an EEAState is chosen, see Regulation [(EC) No.593/2008](/european/regulation/2008/0593?view=plain \"Go to item oflegislation\") of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 onthe law applicable to contractual obligations.\n\t\tChanges to other legislation\n\t\t\tSchedule 4 (amendments consequential on this Part) has effect.\n\t\tInterpretation of Part 2\n\t\t\tIn this Part\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cconsumer contract\u201d has the meaning given by section 61(3); \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cconsumer notice\u201d has the meaning given by section 61(7); \n\t\t\t\t  * \u201ctransparent\u201d is to be construed in accordance with sections 64(3) and 68(2). \n\t\t\tThe following have the same meanings in this Part as they have in Part 1\u2014\n\t\t\t\t
