    "general": "The Consumer Rights Act 2015 is a law that protects you when buying goods or services from businesses. It makes sure that what you buy is of good quality, fits its description, and works properly. If something goes wrong, you can ask the business to fix it or give you a refund. The law also gives you more power to take legal action against businesses if they don't follow these rules. Additionally, the law allows regulators like Trading Standards to investigate businesses that break these rules and impose fines on them.",
