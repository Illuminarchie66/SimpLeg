    "general": "The Energy Act 2011 is a law that helps improve the energy efficiency of buildings and homes in the United Kingdom. It encourages property owners and renters to make changes to their homes to reduce energy waste and lower heating bills. The law also promotes the use of cleaner energy sources like wind and solar power. Additionally, it ensures that energy companies provide accurate information to consumers about their energy usage and costs. Finally, the law provides for the secure operation of nuclear power plants and the decommissioning of old ones.",
