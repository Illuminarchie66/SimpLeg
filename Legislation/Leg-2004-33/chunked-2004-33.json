dissolves a civil partnershipon the ground that it has broken down irretrievably;\n\t\t\tmake an order (a \u201cnullity order\u201d) which annuls a civil partnership which isvoid or voidable;\n\t\t\tmake an order (a \u201cpresumption of death order\u201d) which dissolves a civilpartnership on the ground that one of the civil partners is presumed to bedead;\n\t\t\tmake an order (a \u201cseparation order\u201d) which provides for the separation ofthe civil partners.\n\t\tEvery dissolution, nullity or presumption of death order\u2014\n\t\t\tis, in the first instance, a conditional order, and\n\t\t\tmay not be made final before the end of the prescribed period (see section38);\n\t\t\t\tand any reference in this Chapter to a conditional order is to be readaccordingly.\n\t\tA nullity order made where a civil partnership is voidable annuls the civilpartnership only as respects any time after the order has been made final, andthe civil partnership is to be treated (despite the order) as if it hadexisted up to that time.\n\t\tIn this Chapter, other than in sections 58 to 61, \u201cthe court\u201d means\u2014\n\t\t\tthe High Court, or\n\t\t\tif a county court has jurisdiction by virtue of Part 5 of the Matrimonialand Family Proceedings Act [1984 (c. 42)](/id/ukpga/1984/42?view=plain \"Go toitem of legislation\"), a county court.\n\t\tThis Chapter is subject to sections 219 to 224 (jurisdiction of the court).\n\tThe period before conditional orders may be made final\n\t\tSubject to subsections (2) to (4), the prescribed period for the purposesof section 37(2)(b) is\u2014\n\t\t\t6 weeks from the making of the conditional order, or\n\t\t\tif the 6 week period would end on a day on which the office or registry ofthe court dealing with the case is closed, the period of 6 weeks extended tothe end of the first day on which the office or registry is next open.\n\t\tThe Lord Chancellor may by order amend this section so as to substitute adifferent definition of the prescribed period for the purposes of section37(2)(b).\n\t\tBut the Lord Chancellor may not under subsection (2) provide for a periodlonger than 6 months to be the prescribed period.\n\t\tIn a particular case the court dealing with the case may by order shortenthe prescribed period.\n\t\tThe power to make an order under subsection (2) is exercisable by statutoryinstrument.\n\t\tAn instrument containing such an order is subject to annulment in pursuanceof a resolution of either House of Parliament.\n\tIntervention of the Queen\u2019s Proctor\n\t\tThis section applies if an application has been made for a dissolution,nullity or presumption of death order.\n\t\tThe court may, if it thinks fit, direct that all necessary papers in thematter are to be sent to the Queen\u2019s Proctor who must under the directions ofthe Attorney General instruct counsel to argue before the court any questionin relation to the matter which the court considers it necessary or expedientto have fully argued.\n\t\tIf any person at any time\u2014\n\t\t\tduring the progress of the proceedings, or\n\t\t\tbefore the conditional order is made final,\n\t\t\t\tgives information to the Queen\u2019s Proctor on any matter material to the duedecision of the case, the Queen\u2019s Proctor may take such steps as the AttorneyGeneral considers necessary or expedient.\n\t\tIf the Queen\u2019s Proctor intervenes or shows cause against the making of theconditional order in any proceedings relating to its making, the court maymake such order as may be just as to\u2014\n\t\t\tthe payment by other parties to the proceedings of the costs incurred byhim in doing so, or\n\t\t\tthe payment by the Queen\u2019s Proctor of any costs incurred by any of thoseparties because of his doing so.\n\t\tThe Queen\u2019s Proctor is entitled to charge as part of the expenses of hisoffice\u2014\n\t\t\tthe costs of any proceedings under subsection (2);\n\t\t\tif his reasonable costs of intervening or showing cause as mentioned insubsection (4) are not fully satisfied by an order under subsection (4)(a),the amount of the difference;\n\t\t\tif the Treasury so directs, any costs which he pays to any parties under anorder made under subsection (4)(b).\n\tProceedings before order has been made final\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\ta conditional order has been made, and\n\t\t\tthe Queen\u2019s Proctor, or any person who has not been a party to proceedingsin which the order was made, shows cause why the order should not be madefinal on the ground that material facts have not been brought before thecourt.\n\t\tThis section also applies if\u2014\n\t\t\ta conditional order has been made,\n\t\t\t3 months have elapsed since the earliest date on which an application couldhave been made for the order to be made final,\n\t\t\tno such application has been made by the civil partner who applied for theconditional order, and\n\t\t\tthe other civil partner makes an application to the court under thissubsection.\n\t\tThe court may\u2014\n\t\t\tmake the order final,\n\t\t\trescind the order,\n\t\t\trequire further inquiry, or\n\t\t\totherwise deal with the case as it thinks fit.\n\t\tSubsection (3)(a)\u2014\n\t\t\tapplies despite section 37(2) (period before conditional orders may be madefinal), but\n\t\t\tis subject to section 48(4) (protection for respondent in separation cases)and section 63 (restrictions on making of orders affecting children).\n\tTime bar on applications for dissolution orders\n\t\tNo application for a dissolution order may be made to the court before theend of the period of 1 year from the date of the formation of the civilpartnership.\n\t\tNothing in this section prevents the making of an application based onmatters which occurred before the end of the 1 year period.\n\tAttempts at reconciliation of civil partners\n\t\tThis section applies in relation to cases where an application is made fora dissolution or separation order.\n\t\tRules of court must make provision for requiring the solicitor acting forthe applicant to certify whether he has\u2014\n\t\t\tdiscussed with the applicant the possibility of a reconciliation with theother civil partner, and\n\t\t\tgiven the applicant the names and addresses of persons qualified to helpeffect a reconciliation between civil partners who have become estranged.\n\t\tIf at any stage of proceedings for the order it appears to the court thatthere is a reasonable possibility of a reconciliation between the civilpartners, the court may adjourn the proceedings for such period as it thinksfit to enable attempts to be made to effect a reconciliation between them.\n\t\tThe power to adjourn under subsection (3) is additional to any other powerof adjournment.\n\tConsideration by the court of certain agreements or arrangements\n\t\tThis section applies in relation to cases where\u2014\n\t\t\tproceedings for a dissolution or separation order are contemplated or havebegun, and\n\t\t\tan agreement or arrangement is made or proposed to be made between thecivil partners which relates to, arises out of, or is connected with, theproceedings.\n\t\tRules of court may make provision for enabling\u2014\n\t\t\tthe civil partners, or either of them, to refer the agreement orarrangement to the court, and\n\t\t\tthe court\u2014\n\t\t\tto express an opinion, if it thinks it desirable to do so, as to thereasonableness of the agreement or arrangement, and\n\t\t\tto give such directions, if any, in the matter as it thinks fit."

reasonably can, into\u2014\n\t\t\tthe facts alleged by the applicant, and\n\t\t\tany facts alleged by the respondent.\n\t\tThe court hearing an application for a dissolution order must not hold thatthe civil partnership has broken down irretrievably unless the applicantsatisfies the court of one or more of the facts described in subsection(5)(a), (b), (c) or (d).\n\t\tBut if the court is satisfied of any of those facts, it must make adissolution order unless it is satisfied on all the evidence that the civilpartnership has not broken down irretrievably.\n\t\tThe facts referred to in

inreliance on section 44(5)(a), that the respondent has behaved in such a waythat the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent,but\n\t\t\tafter the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by theapplicant and held by the court to support his allegation, the applicant andthe respondent have lived together for a period (or periods) which does not,or which taken together do not, exceed 6 months.\n\t\tThe fact that the applicant and respondent have lived together as mentionedin subsection (1)(b) must be disregarded in determining, for the purposes ofsection 44(5)(a), whether the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to livewith the respondent.\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies in relation to cases where the applicant alleges, inreliance on section 44(5)(b), that the respondent consents to a dissolutionorder being made.\n\t\tRules of court must make provision for the purpose of ensuring that therespondent has been given such information as will enable him to understand\u2014\n\t\t\tthe consequences to him of consenting to the making of the order, and\n\t\t\tthe steps which he must take to indicate his consent.\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 44(5)(d) the court may treat a period ofdesertion as having continued at a time when the deserting civil partner wasincapable of continuing the necessary intention, if the evidence before thecourt is such that, had he not been so incapable, the court would haveinferred that the desertion continued at that time.\n\t\tIn considering for the purposes of section 44(5) whether the period forwhich the civil partners have lived apart or the period for which therespondent has deserted the applicant has been continuous, no account is to betaken of\u2014\n\t\t\tany one period not exceeding 6 months, or\n\t\t\tany two or more periods not exceeding 6 months in all,\n\t\t\t\tduring which the civil partners resumed living with each other.\n\t\tBut no period during which the civil partners have lived with each othercounts as part of the period during which the civil partners have lived apartor as part of the period of desertion.\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 44(5)(b) and (c) and this

the separationorder has been continuously in force since it was made,\n\t\t\tthe period of desertion is to be treated for the purposes of the applicationfor the dissolution order as if it had immediately preceded the making of theapplication.\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 44(5)(d) the court may treat as a period duringwhich the respondent has deserted the applicant any period during

in 5 year separation cases on ground of gravehardship\n\t\tThe respondent to an application for a dissolution order in which theapplicant alleges 5 years' separation may oppose the making of an order on theground that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe dissolution of the civil partnership will result in grave financial orother hardship to him, and\n\t\t\tit would in all the circumstances be wrong to dissolve the

of hisapplication on the fact of 5 years' separation and makes no such finding as toany other fact mentioned in section 44(5), and\n\t\t\tapart from this section, the court would make a dissolution order.\n\t\tThe court must\u2014\n\t\t\tconsider all the circumstances, including the conduct of the civil partnersand the interests of the civil partners and of any children or other

loss of the chance of acquiring any benefit whichthe respondent might acquire if the civil partnership were not dissolved.\n\tProceedings before order made final: protection for respondent inseparation cases\n\t\tThe court may, on an application made by the respondent, rescind aconditional dissolution order if\u2014\n\t\t\tit made the order on the basis of a finding that the applicant

section 44(5),and\n\t\t\tit is satisfied that the applicant misled the respondent (whetherintentionally or unintentionally) about any matter which the respondent tookinto account in deciding to give his consent.\n\t\tSubsections (3) to (5) apply if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe respondent to an application for a dissolution order in which theapplicant alleged\u2014\n\t\t\t2 years' separation coupled with the

partner in a civil partnership for arelevant interdict by reason only that the civil partners are living togetherin civil partnership.\n\t\tIn subsection (1) and in section 114, \u201crelevant interdict\u201d means aninterdict, including an interim interdict, which\u2014\n\t\t\trestrains or prohibits any conduct of one civil partner towards the othercivil partner or a child of the family, or\n\t\t\tprohibits a civil partner from entering or remaining in a family home or ina specified area in the vicinity of a family home.\n\tAttachment of powers of arrest to relevant interdicts\n\t\tSubject to subsection (2), the court is, on the application of an applicantcivil partner, to attach a power of arrest\u2014\n\t\t\tto any relevant interdict which is ancillary to an exclusion order(including an interim order under section 104(6));\n\t\t\tto any other relevant interdict where the non-applicant civil partner hashad the opportunity of being heard by or represented before the court, unlessit appears to the court that in all the circumstances of the case such a poweris unnecessary.\n\t\tThe court may attach a power of arrest to an interdict by virtue ofsubsection (1) only if satisfied that attaching the power would not result inthe non-applicant civil partner being subject, in relation to the interdict,to a power of arrest under both this Chapter and the Protection from Abuse(Scotland) Act [2001 (asp 14)](/id/asp/2001/14?view=plain \"Go to item oflegislation\").\n\t\tA power of arrest attached to an interdict by virtue of subsection (1) doesnot have effect until such interdict together with the attached power ofarrest is served on the non-applicant civil partner; and such a power ofarrest, unless previously recalled, ceases to have effect upon the dissolutionof the civil partnership.\n\t\tIf, by virtue of subsection (1), a power of arrest is attached to aninterdict, a constable may arrest without warrant the non-applicant civilpartner if the constable has reasonable cause for suspecting that civilpartner of being in breach of the interdict.\n\t\tIf, by virtue of subsection (1), a power of arrest is attached to aninterdict, the applicant civil partner is, as soon as possible after serviceof the interdict, to ensure that there is delivered\u2014\n\t\t\tto the chief constable of the police area in which the family home issituated, and\n\t\t\tif the applicant civil partner resides in another police area, to the chiefconstable of that other police area,\n\t\t\t\ta copy of the application for the interdict and of the interlocutor grantingthe interdict together with a certificate of service of the interdict and,where the application to attach the power of arrest to the interdict was madeafter the interdict was granted, a copy of that application and of theinterlocutor granting it and a certificate of service of the interdicttogether with the attached power of arrest.\n\t\tWhere any relevant interdict to which, by virtue of subsection (1), thereis attached a power of arrest, is varied or recalled, the civil partner whoapplied for the variation or recall is to ensure that there is delivered\u2014\n\t\t\tto the chief constable of the police area in which the family home issituated, and\n\t\t\tif the applicant civil partner resides in another police area, to the chiefconstable of that other police area,\n\t\t\ta copy of the application for variation or recall and of the interlocutorgranting the variation or recall.\n\t\tIn this section and in sections 115 and 116\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201capplicant civil partner\u201d means the civil partner who has applied for the interdict, and \n\t\t\t  * \u201cnon-applicant civil partner\u201d is to be construed accordingly. \n\tPolice powers after arrest\n\t\tWhere a person has been arrested under section 114(4), the officer incharge of a police station may\u2014\n\t\t\tif satisfied that there is no likelihood of violence to the applicant civilpartner or any child of the family, liberate that person unconditionally, or\n\t\t\trefuse to liberate that person.\n\t\tFor such refusal and the detention of that person until appearance in courtby virtue of section 116(2) or of any provision of the Criminal Procedure(Scotland) Act [1975 (c. 21)](/id/ukpga/1975/21?view=plain \"Go to item oflegislation\") the officer is not to be subjected to any claim whatsoever.\n\t\tWhere a person arrested under section 114(4) is liberated under subsection(1), the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the arrest are to bereported forthwith to the procurator fiscal who, if he decides to take nocriminal proceedings in respect of those facts and circumstances, is at theearliest opportunity to take all reasonable steps to intimate his decision tothe persons mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 116(5).\n\tProcedure after arrest\n\t\tThe provisions of this section apply only where\u2014\n\t\t\tthe non-applicant civil partner has not been liberated under section115(1), and\n\t\t\tthe procurator fiscal decides that no criminal proceedings are to be takenin respect of the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the arrest.\n\t\tThe non-applicant civil partner who has been arrested under section 114(4)is wherever practicable to be brought before the sheriff sitting as a court ofsummary criminal jurisdiction for the district in which that civil partner wasarrested not later than in the course of the first day after the arrest, suchday not being a Saturday, a Sunday or a court holiday prescribed for thatcourt under section 8 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act [1995 (c.46)](/id/ukpga/1995/46?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\").\n\t\tNothing in subsection (2) prevents the non-applicant civil partner beingbrought before the sheriff on a Saturday, a Sunday or such a court holidaywhen the sheriff is, in pursuance of that section of that Act, sitting for thedisposal of criminal business.\n\t\tSubsections (1) to (3) of section 15 of that Act (intimation to a namedperson) apply to a non-applicant civil partner who has been arrested undersection 114(4) as they apply to a person who has been arrested in respect ofany offence.\n\t\tThe procurator fiscal is at the earliest opportunity, and in any eventprior to the non-applicant civil partner being brought before the sheriffunder subsection (2), to take all reasonable steps to intimate\u2014\n\t\t\tto the applicant civil partner, and\n\t\t\tto the solicitor who acted for that civil partner when the interdict wasgranted or to any other solicitor who the procurator fiscal has reason tobelieve acts for the time being for that civil partner,\n\t\t\t\tthat the criminal proceedings referred to in subsection (1) will not be taken.\n\t\tOn the non-applicant civil partner being brought before the sheriff undersubsection (2) (as read with subsection (3)), the following procedures apply\u2014\n\t\t\tthe procurator fiscal is to present to the court a petition containing\u2014\n\t\t\ta statement of the particulars of the non-applicant civil partner,\n\t\t\ta statement of the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the arrest,and\n\t\t\ta request that the non-applicant civil partner be detained for a furtherperiod not exceeding 2 days,\n\t\t\tif it appears to the sheriff that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe statement referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) ostensibly discloses abreach of interdict by the non-applicant civil partner,\n\t\t\tproceedings for breach of interdict will be taken, and\n\t\t\tthere is a substantial risk of violence by the non-applicant civilpartner against the applicant civil partner or any child of the family,\n\t\t\the may order the non-applicant civil partner to be detained for a furtherperiod not exceeding 2 days, and\n\t\t\tin any case to which paragraph (b) does not apply, the non-applicant civilpartner is, unless in custody in respect of any other matter, to be releasedfrom custody.\n\t\tIn computing the period of 2 days referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) ofsubsection (6), no account is to be taken of a Saturday or Sunday or of anyholiday in the court in which the proceedings for breach of interdict willrequire to be raised."

of Session or in the sheriff court.\n\t\t\tIn such an action the court may grant decree, if, but only if, it isestablished that\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe civil partnership has broken down irretrievably, or\n\t\t\t\tan interim gender recognition certificate under the Gender Recognition Act[2004 (c. 7)](/id/ukpga/2004/7?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\") has,after the date of registration of the civil partnership, been issued to eitherof the civil partners.\n\t\t\tThe irretrievable breakdown of a civil partnership is taken to beestablished if\u2014\n\t\t\t\tsince the date of registration of the civil partnership the defender has atany time behaved (whether or not as a result of mental abnormality and whethersuch behaviour has been active or passive) in such a way that the pursuercannot reasonably be expected to cohabit with the defender,\n\t\t\t\tthe defender has wilfully and without reasonable cause deserted the pursuerand during a continuous period of two years immediately succeeding thedefender\u2019s desertion\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthere has been no cohabitation between the parties, and\n\t\t\t\tthe pursuer has not refused a genuine and reasonable offer by the defenderto adhere,\n\t\t\t\tthere has been no cohabitation between the civil partners at any timeduring a continuous period of two years after the date of registration of thecivil partnership and immediately preceding the bringing of the action and thedefender consents to the granting of decree of dissolution of the civilpartnership, or\n\t\t\t\tthere has been no cohabitation between the civil partners at any timeduring a continuous period of 5 years after that date and immediatelypreceding the bringing of the action.\n\t\t\tProvision is to be made by act of sederunt\u2014\n\t\t\t\tfor the purpose of ensuring that, in an action to which paragraph (c) ofsubsection (3) relates, the defender has been given such information asenables that civil partner to understand\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe consequences of consenting to the granting of decree, and\n\t\t\t\tthe steps which must be taken to indicate such consent, and\n\t\t\t\tas to the manner in which the defender in such an action is to indicatesuch consent, and any withdrawal of such consent,\n\t\t\t\t\tand where the defender has indicated (and not withdrawn) such consent in theprescribed manner, that indication is sufficient evidence of such consent.\n\t\t\tProvision is to be made by act of sederunt for the purpose of ensuringthat, where in an action for the dissolution of a civil partnership thedefender is suffering from mental illness, the court appoints a curator adlitem to the defender.\n\t\t\tIn an action to which paragraph (d) of subsection (3) relates, even thoughirretrievable breakdown of the civil partnership is established the court isnot bound to grant decree if in its opinion to do so would result in gravefinancial hardship to the defender.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (6), hardship includes the loss of thechance of acquiring any benefit.\n\t\t\tIn an action for dissolution of a civil partnership the standard of proofrequired to establish the ground of action is on balance of probability.\n\t\tEncouragement of reconciliation\n\t\t\tAt any time before granting decree in an action by virtue of paragraph (a)of section 117(2) for dissolution of a civil partnership, if it appears to thecourt that there is a reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between thecivil partners it must continue, or further continue, the action for suchperiod as it thinks proper to enable attempts to be made to effect such areconciliation.\n\t\t\tIf during any such continuation the civil partners cohabit with oneanother, no account is to be taken of such cohabitation for the purposes ofthat action.\n\t\tEffect of resumption of cohabitation\n\t\t\tIn an action to which paragraph (b) of section 117(3) relates, theirretrievable breakdown of a civil partnership is not to be taken to beestablished if, after the expiry of the period mentioned in that paragraph\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe pursuer resumes cohabitation with the defender, and\n\t\t\t\tcohabits with the defender at any time after the end of a period of 3months commencing with the date of such resumption.\n\t\t\tSubsection (1) is subject to section 118(2).\n\t\t\tIn considering whether any period mentioned in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) ofsection 117(3) has been continuous, no account is to be taken of any period orperiods not exceeding 6 months in all during which the civil partnerscohabited with one another; but no such period or periods during which thecivil partners cohabited with one another is to count as part of the period ofnon-cohabitation required by any of those paragraphs.\n\t\tSeparation \n\t\t\tAn action for the separation of the civil partners in a civil partnershipmay be brought in the Court of Session or in the sheriff court.\n\t\t\tIn such an action the court may grant decree if satisfied that thecircumstances set out in any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 117(3) areestablished.\n\t\tDissolution following on decree of separation\n\t\t\tThe court may grant decree in an action for the dissolution of a civilpartnership even though decree of separation has previously been granted tothe pursuer on the same, or substantially the same, facts as those averred insupport of that action; and in any such action the court may treat an extractdecree of separation lodged in process as sufficient proof of the facts underwhich that decree was granted.\n\t\t\tNothing in this section entitles a court to grant decree of dissolution ofa civil partnership without receiving evidence from the pursuer.\n\t\tRegistration of dissolution of civil partnership\n\t\t\tThe Registrar General is

madeto the court by either civil partner on the ground that the civil partnershiphas broken down irretrievably.\n\t\tOn an application for a dissolution order the court must inquire, so far asit reasonably can, into\u2014\n\t\t\tthe facts alleged by the applicant, and\n\t\t\tany facts alleged by the respondent.\n\t\tThe court hearing an application for a dissolution order must not hold thatthe civil partnership has broken down irretrievably unless the applicantsatisfies the court of one or more of the facts described in subsection(5)(a), (b), (c) or (d).\n\t\tBut if the court is satisfied of any of those facts, it must make adissolution order unless it is satisfied on all the evidence that the civilpartnership has not broken down irretrievably.\n\t\tThe facts referred to in subsections (3) and (4) are\u2014\n\t\t\tthat the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannotreasonably be expected to live with the respondent;\n\t\t\tthat\u2014 \n\t\t\tthe applicant and the respondent have lived apart for a continuous periodof at least 2 years immediately preceding the making of the application (\u201c2years' separation\u201d), and\n\t\t\tthe respondent consents to a dissolution order being made;\n\t\t\tthat the applicant and the respondent have lived apart for a continuousperiod of at least 5 years immediately preceding the making of the application(\u201c5 years' separation\u201d);\n\t\t\tthat the respondent has deserted the applicant for a continuous period ofat least 2 years immediately preceding the making of the application.\n\t\tThe court must not make a dissolution order without considering the oraltestimony of the applicant unless for special reasons it orders that suchtestimony be dispensed with.\n\tSupplemental provisions as to facts raising presumption of breakdown\n\t\tSubsection (2) applies if\u2014\n\t\t\tin any proceedings for a dissolution order the applicant alleges, inreliance on section 168(5)(a), that the respondent has behaved in such a waythat the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent,but\n\t\t\tafter the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by theapplicant and held by the court to support his allegation, the applicant andthe respondent have lived together for a period (or periods) which does not,or which taken together do not, exceed 6 months.\n\t\tThe fact that the applicant and respondent have lived together as mentionedin subsection (1)(b) must be disregarded in determining, for the purposes ofsection 168(5)(a), whether the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to livewith the respondent.\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies in relation to cases where the applicant alleges, inreliance on section 168(5)(b), that the respondent consents to a dissolutionorder being made.\n\t\tRules of court must make provision for the purpose of ensuring that therespondent has been given such information as will enable him to understand\u2014\n\t\t\tthe consequences to him of consenting to the order, and\n\t\t\tthe steps which he must take to indicate his consent.\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 168(5)(d) the court may treat a period ofdesertion as having continued at a time when the deserting civil partner wasincapable of continuing the necessary intention, if the evidence before thecourt is such that, had he not been so incapable, the court would haveinferred that the desertion continued at that time.\n\t\tIn considering for the purposes of section 168(5) whether the period forwhich the civil partners have lived apart or the period for which therespondent has deserted the applicant has been continuous, no account is to betaken of\u2014\n\t\t\tany one period not exceeding 6 months, or\n\t\t\tany two or more periods not exceeding 6 months in all,\n\t\t\t\tduring which the civil partners resumed living together.\n\t\tBut no period during which the civil partners have lived with each othercounts as part of the period during which the civil partners have lived apartor as part of the period of desertion.\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 168(5)(b) and (c) and this section civilpartners are to be treated as living apart unless they are living with eachother in the same household, and references in this section to civil partnersliving with each other are to be read as references to their living with eachother in the same household.\n\tDissolution order not precluded by previous separation order etc.\n\t\tSubsections (2) and (3) apply if any of the following orders has been madein relation to a civil partnership\u2014\n\t\t\ta separation order;\n\t\t\tan order under Schedule 16 (financial relief in court of summaryjurisdiction etc.);\n\t\t\tan occupation order under Article 11 of the Family Homes and DomesticViolence (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 ([S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I.6)](/id/nisi/1998/1071?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\") (occupationorders));\n\t\t\tan order under Article 15 of that Order (orders where neither civil partnerentitled to occupy the home).\n\t\tNothing prevents\u2014\n\t\t\teither civil partner from applying for a dissolution order, or\n\t\t\tthe court from making a dissolution order,\n\t\t\t\ton the same facts, or substantially the same facts, as those proved in supportof the making of the order referred to in subsection (1).\n\t\tOn the application for the dissolution order, the court\u2014\n\t\t\tmay treat the order referred to in subsection (1) as sufficient proof ofany desertion or other fact by reference to which it was made, but\n\t\t\tmust not make the dissolution order without receiving evidence from theapplicant.\n\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\tthe application for the dissolution order follows a separation order or anyorder requiring the civil partners to live apart,\n\t\t\tthere was a period of desertion immediately preceding the institution ofthe proceedings for the separation order, and\n\t\t\tthe civil partners have not resumed living together and the separationorder has been continuously in force since it was made,\n\t\t\tthe period of desertion is to be treated for the purposes of the applicationfor the dissolution order as if it had immediately preceded the making of theapplication.\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 168(5)(d) the court may treat as a periodduring which the respondent has deserted the applicant any period during whichthere is in force\u2014\n\t\t\tan injunction granted by the High Court or a county court which excludesthe respondent from the civil partnership home, or\n\t\t\tan order under Article 11 or 15 of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence(Northern Ireland) Order 1998 ([S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I.6)](/id/nisi/1998/1071?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\")) whichprohibits the respondent from occupying a dwelling-house in which theapplicant and the respondent have, or at any time have had, a civilpartnership home.\n\tRefusal of dissolution in 5 year separation cases on ground of gravehardship\n\t\tThe respondent to an application for a dissolution order in which theapplicant alleges 5 years' separation may oppose the making of an order on theground that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe dissolution of the civil partnership will result in grave financial orother hardship to him, and\n\t\t\tit would in all the circumstances be wrong to dissolve the civilpartnership.\n\t\tSubsection (3) applies if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe making of a dissolution order is opposed under this section,\n\t\t\tthe court finds that the applicant is entitled to rely in support of hisapplication on the fact of 5 years' separation and makes no such finding as toany other fact mentioned in section 168(5), and\n\t\t\tapart from this section, the court would make a dissolution order.\n\t\tThe court must\u2014\n\t\t\tconsider all the circumstances, including the conduct of the civil partnersand the interests of the civil partners and of any children or other personsconcerned, and\n\t\t\tif it is of the opinion that the ground mentioned in subsection (1) is madeout, dismiss the application for the dissolution order.\n\t\t\u201cHardship\u201d includes the loss of the chance of acquiring any benefit whichthe respondent might acquire if the civil partnership were not dissolved.\n\tProceedings before order made final: protection for respondent inseparation cases\n\t\tThe court may, on an application made by the respondent, rescind aconditional dissolution order if\u2014\n\t\t\tit made the order on the basis of a finding that the applicant was entitledto rely on the fact of 2 years' separation coupled with the respondent\u2019sconsent to a dissolution order being made,\n\t\t\tit made no such finding as to any other fact mentioned in section 168(5),and\n\t\t\tit is satisfied that the applicant misled the respondent (whetherintentionally or unintentionally) about any matter which the respondent tookinto account in deciding to give his consent.\n\t\tSubsections (3) to (5) apply if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe respondent to an application for a dissolution order in which theapplicant alleged\u2014\n\t\t\t2 years' separation coupled with the respondent\u2019s consent to a dissolutionorder being made, or\n\t\t\t5 years' separation,\n\t\t\t\thas applied to the court for consideration under subsection (3) of hisfinancial position after the dissolution of the civil partnership, and\n\t\t\tthe court\u2014\n\t\t\thas made a conditional dissolution order on the basis of a finding that theapplicant was entitled to rely in support of his application on the fact of 2years' or 5 years' separation, and\n\t\t\thas made no such finding as to any other fact mentioned in section 168(5).\n\t\tThe court hearing an application by the respondent under subsection (2)must consider all the circumstances, including\u2014\n\t\t\tthe age, health, conduct, earning capacity, financial resources andfinancial obligations of each of the parties, and\n\t\t\tthe financial position of the respondent as, having regard to thedissolution, it is likely to be after the death of the applicant should theapplicant die first.\n\t\tThe court must not make the order final unless it has, by order, declaredthat it is satisfied that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe applicant should not be required to make any financial provision forthe respondent,\n\t\t\tthe financial provision made by the applicant for the respondent is\u2014\n\t\t\treasonable and fair, or\n\t\t\tthe best that can be made in the circumstances, or\n\t\t\tthere are circumstances making it desirable that the order should be madefinal without delay.\n\t\tThe court must not make an order declaring that it is satisfied asmentioned in subsection (4)(c) unless it has obtained a satisfactoryundertaking from the applicant that he will bring the question of financialprovision for the respondent before the court within a specified time.\n\t\tSubsection (7) applies if, following an application under subsection (2)which is not withdrawn, the court makes the order final without making anorder under subsection (4).\n\t\tThe final order is voidable at the instance of the respondent or of thecourt but no person is entitled to challenge the validity of the order afterit is made final on the ground that subsections (4) and (5) were notsatisfied.\n\t\tIf the court refuses to make an order under subsection (4), it must, on anapplication by the applicant, make an order declaring that it is not satisfiedas mentioned in that subsection."
