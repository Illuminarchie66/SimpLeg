    "summary": "The Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Act 2021 is a new law that will make punishments for people who hurt animals more severe. Before, the most someone could get for hurting an animal was 6 months in jail, but now it can be up to 12 months. This law only applies to England and Wales, and it won't affect anyone who did something bad to an animal before the law was passed. So if you hurt an animal, you might go to jail for longer now!",
