    "summary": "The Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013 regulates the buying and selling of scrap metal in the United Kingdom. To operate legally, scrap metal dealers must obtain a license from the local council and display it prominently at each site and on any vehicles used in their business. Additionally, dealers must verify the identity of their suppliers through reliable sources before accepting scrap metal, and keep detailed records of all transactions. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines up to \u00a35,000. Inspectors from the government can visit licensed and unlicensed sites to ensure compliance with the law and take action against those who do not follow the rules."
