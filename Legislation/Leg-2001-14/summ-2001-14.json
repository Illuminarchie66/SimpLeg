    "summary": "The Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001 helps farmers and small business owners in rural areas save money on their property taxes. This law gives these properties special treatment so they don't have to pay as much in taxes. It applies to old farm buildings that are now used as shops or storage spaces for food. This means that if you run a small shop or store in a rural area, you might be able to get a discount on your property taxes. The law only applies to certain parts of England and Wales, so check if you are eligible.",
