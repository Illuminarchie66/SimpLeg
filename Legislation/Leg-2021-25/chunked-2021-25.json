when\u2014\n\t\t\ta person gains control of a qualifying entity, as set out in section 8, or\n\t\t\ta person gains control of a qualifying asset, as set out in section 9.\n\t\tIn this Act \u201cacquirer\u201d means the person who gains the control referred toin subsection (1) (or in relation to a trigger event that has not yet takenplace, would gain that control).\n\tNotifiable acquisitions\n\t\tThe Secretary of State may make regulations for the purposes of thissection (\u201cnotifiable acquisition regulations\u201d).\n\t\tA notifiable acquisition takes place when a person gains control, by virtueof one or more of the cases described in subsection (2), (5) or (6) of section8, of a qualifying entity of a specified description.\n\t\tBut a notifiable acquisition does not take place if complying with therequirement to give a mandatory notice under section 14(1) would be impossiblefor the person within subsection (2).\n\t\tA description of qualifying entity that is specified must include provisionthat the entity carries on activities in the United Kingdom which are of aspecified description (whether or not it also carries on other activities).\n\t\tNotifiable acquisition regulations may\u2014\n\t\t\tamend this section in relation to the circumstances in which a notifiableacquisition takes place or does not take place,\n\t\t\tmake provision for exemptions by reference to the characteristics of theperson within subsection (2),\n\t\t\tmake consequential amendments of other provisions of this Act.\n\t\tNotifiable acquisition regulations may by virtue of subsection (5)(a)include, in particular, provision about the circumstances in which the gainingof control of a qualifying asset of a specified description is a notifiableacquisition.\n\t\tA description specified under subsection (6) may only include qualifyingassets within section 7(6) if it includes provision that any such asset isused in connection with activities carried on in the United Kingdom which areof a specified description (whether or not it is also used in connection withother activities).\n\t\tIn this section \u201cspecified\u201d means specified in notifiable acquisitionregulations.\n\tQualifying entities and assets\n\t\tThis section defines \u201cqualifying entity\u201d and \u201cqualifying asset\u201d for thepurposes of this Act.\n\t\tA \u201cqualifying entity\u201d is (subject to subsection (3)) any entity, whether ornot a legal person, that is not an individual, and includes a company, alimited liability partnership, any other body corporate, a partnership, anunincorporated association and a trust.\n\t\tAn entity which is formed or recognised under the law of a country orterritory outside the United Kingdom is a \u201cqualifying entity\u201d only if it\u2014\n\t\t\tcarries on activities in the United Kingdom, or\n\t\t\tsupplies goods or services to persons in the United Kingdom.\n\t\tA \u201cqualifying asset\u201d is (subject to subsection (6)) an asset of any of thefollowing types\u2014\n\t\t\tland, \n\t\t\ttangible (or, in Scotland, corporeal) moveable property,\n\t\t\tideas, information or techniques which have industrial, commercial or othereconomic value.\n\t\tExamples of assets within subsection (4)(c) include\u2014\n\t\t\ttrade secrets,\n\t\t\tdatabases, \n\t\t\tsource code,\n\t\t\talgorithms, \n\t\t\tformulae, \n\t\t\tdesigns, \n\t\t\tplans, drawings and specifications,\n\t\t\tsoftware. \n\t\tLand or moveable property situated outside the United Kingdom or theterritorial sea, or any asset within subsection (4)(c), is a \u201cqualifyingasset\u201d only if it is used in connection with\u2014\n\t\t\tactivities carried on in the United Kingdom, or\n\t\t\tthe supply of goods or services to persons in the United Kingdom.\n\tControl of entities\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Act, a person gains control of a qualifying entityif the person acquires a right or interest in, or in relation to, the entityand as a result one or more of the cases described in this section arises.\n\t\tThe first case is where the percentage of the shares that the person holdsin the entity increases\u2014\n\t\t\tfrom 25% or less to more than 25%,\n\t\t\tfrom 50% or less to more than 50%, or\n\t\t\tfrom less than 75% to 75% or more.\n\t\tIn subsection (2), the reference to holding a percentage of shares is\u2014\n\t\t\tin the case of an entity that has a share capital, to holding sharescomprised in the issued share capital of the entity of a nominal value (inaggregate) of that percentage of the share capital,\n\t\t\tin the case of an entity that does not have a share capital, to holding aright to a share of that percentage of the capital or profits of the entity,\n\t\t\tin the case of a limited liability partnership, to holding a right to ashare of that percentage of any surplus assets of the partnership on a windingup.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (3)(c), to the extent that rights to sharein any surplus assets of the limited liability partnership on a winding up arenot expressly provided for, each member of the partnership is to be treated asholding the right to an equal share of such assets.\n\t\tThe second case is where the percentage of the voting rights that theperson holds in the entity increases\u2014\n\t\t\tfrom 25% or less to more than 25%,\n\t\t\tfrom 50% or less to more than 50%, or\n\t\t\tfrom less than 75% to 75% or more.\n\t\tThe third case is where the acquisition is of voting rights in the entitythat (whether alone or together with other voting rights held by the person)enable the person to secure or prevent the passage of any class of resolutiongoverning the affairs of the entity.\n\t\tIn subsections (5) and (6), a reference to the voting rights in an entityis\u2014\n\t\t\tin the case of an entity that has a share capital, to the rights conferredon shareholders in respect of their shares to vote at general meetings of theentity on all or substantially all matters,\n\t\t\tin the case of an entity that does not have a share capital, to the rightsconferred on members to vote at general meetings of the entity on all orsubstantially all matters,\n\t\t\t\tand, in the case of an entity that does not have general meetings at whichmatters are decided by such votes, includes any rights in relation to theentity that are of the equivalent effect.\n\t\tThe fourth case is (subject to subsection (9)) where the acquisition,whether alone or together with other interests or rights held by the person,enables the person materially to influence the policy of the entity.\n\t\tSubsection (8) does not include a case where the person already holds anyinterest or right that enables the person materially to influence the policyof the entity.\n\tControl of assets\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Act, a person gains control of a qualifying assetif the person acquires a right or interest in, or in relation to, the assetand as a result the person is able\u2014\n\t\t\tto use the asset, or use it to a greater extent than prior to theacquisition, or\n\t\t\tto direct or control how the asset is used, or direct or control how it isused to a greater extent than prior to the acquisition.\n\t\t\t\tThis is subject to section 11.\n\t\tIn this section, references to the use of an asset include references toits exploitation, alteration, manipulation, disposal or destruction.\n\tHolding and acquiring interests and rights: supplementary\n\t\tSchedule 1 provides for particular cases in which a person is to be treatedfor the purposes of this Act as holding an interest or right.\n\t\tA person is to be treated for the purposes of this Act as acquiring aninterest or right (to the extent that the person would not otherwise beregarded as doing so) where\u2014\n\t\t\tthe interest or right becomes treated as held by the person by virtue ofSchedule 1, or\n\t\t\tthe person is already treated as holding the interest or right by virtue ofthat Schedule and something occurs in relation to the interest or right whichwould be regarded as its acquisition by the person (including by virtue ofparagraph (a)) if the person was not already treated as holding it.\n\tExceptions relating to control of assets\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Act a person is not to be regarded as gainingcontrol of a qualifying asset by reason of an acquisition made by anindividual for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside the individual\u2019strade, business or craft.\n\t\tSubsection (1) does not apply in relation to an asset that\u2014\n\t\t\tis land, or\n\t\t\tfalls within any of the following (as it has effect from time to time)\u2014\n\t\t\tthe Schedule to the Export of Radioactive Sources (Control) Order 2006([S.I.

regulations\u2014\n\t\t\tamend subsection (2) so as to add, vary or remove any asset or descriptionof asset,\n\t\t\tprescribe other circumstances, or descriptions of circumstances, in which aperson is not to be regarded for the purposes of this Act as gaining controlof a qualifying asset.\n\tTrigger events: supplementary\n\t\tIf a trigger event takes place over a period of more than one day, or if itis unclear when during a period of more than one day the event has takenplace, it is treated for the purposes of this Act as taking place on the lastday of the period.\n\t\tSubsections (3) and (4) apply if a person enters into an agreement orarrangement that enables the person (contingently or not) to do something inthe future that would result in a trigger event taking place.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Act, entering into the agreement or arrangementdoes not necessarily establish that arrangements are in progress orcontemplation which, if carried into effect, would result in a trigger eventtaking place.\n\t\tThe question of whether such arrangements are in progress or contemplation(at the time of entry into the agreement or arrangement or subsequently) is tobe determined by reference to all the circumstances, including how likely itis in practice that person will do the thing that would result in a triggerevent taking place."

working days beginning with theday mentioned in subsection (2),\n\t\t\t\t\u201cthe additional period\u201d is the period of 45 working days beginning with thefirst working day after the day on which the initial period ends,\n\t\t\t\ta \u201cvoluntary period\u201d is such period of working days, beginning with thefirst working day after the day on which the additional period (or theprevious voluntary period) ends, as may be agreed in writing between theSecretary of State and the acquirer.\n\t\t\tThe assessment period ends at the end of the initial period unless, beforethe end of the initial period, the Secretary of State gives an additionalperiod notice to each person to whom the call-in notice was given (seesubsection (8)).\n\t\t\tIf an additional period notice is given, the assessment period ends at theend of the additional period unless, before the end of the additional period,a voluntary period is agreed.\n\t\t\tIf a voluntary period is agreed, the assessment period ends at the end ofthe voluntary period, or at the end of any further voluntary period which isagreed.\n\t\t\tThe Secretary of State must give notice of any voluntary period, or furthervoluntary period to each person to whom the call-in notice was given.\n\t\t\tAn \u201cadditional period notice\u201d is a notice which the Secretary of State maygive if the Secretary of State\u2014\n\t\t\t\treasonably believes that\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta trigger event has taken place or that arrangements are in progress orcontemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in a trigger event,and\n\t\t\t\ta risk to national security has arisen from the trigger event or wouldarise from the trigger event if carried into effect, and\n\t\t\t\treasonably considers that the additional period is required to assess thetrigger event further.\n\t\t\tA voluntary period or further voluntary period may be agreed by theSecretary of State only if the Secretary of State\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that\u2014\n\t\t\t\ta trigger event has taken place or that arrangements are in progress orcontemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in a trigger event,and\n\t\t\t\ta
