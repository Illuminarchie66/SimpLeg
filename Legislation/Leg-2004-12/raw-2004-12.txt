#### Matching: distributions not exceeding basic profits, 
4Where in an accounting period the total amount of the distributions made (ortreated as made) by a company does not exceed the amount of its basic profits,the amount of the company’s basic profits matched with non-corporatedistributions is equal to the total amount of the non-corporate distributionsmade (or treated as made) by the company in that period.,

###### Increase of rent after fifth year: whether regarded as abnormal, 
15Whether an increase in rent is to be regarded for the purposes of paragraph14 as abnormal is determined as follows:—, 
  * _Step One_, 
Find the start date, which is—, 
(a), 
where the provisions of that paragraph have not previously applied to a rentincrease under the lease, the beginning of the period by reference to whichthe rent assumed to be payable after the fifth year of the term of the leaseis determined in accordance with paragraph 7(3);, 
(b), 
where the provisions of that paragraph have previously so applied, the date ofthe last increase in relation to which the provisions of that paragraphapplied., 
  * _Step Two_, 
Divide the period between the start date and the date on which the new rentfirst becomes payable (“the reference period”) into—, 
(a), 
successive periods of twelve months running from the start date (if any), and, 
(b), 
any remaining period which does not fall within paragraph (a)., 
  * _Step Three_, 
Find the factor by which the retail prices index has increased over eachperiod identified in step two., 
This is a figure expressed as a decimal and determined by the formula—, 
[![Formula - \(RD minus RI\) divided byRI](/ukpga/2004/12/images/ukpga_20040012_en_097)](/ukpga/2004/12/images/ukpga_20040012_en_097?view=plain), 
where—, 
    * RD is the retail prices index for the month in which the last day of the period in question falls, and, 
    * RI is the retail prices index for the month in which the first day of the period in question falls., 
If, in relation to any period, RD is equal to or less than RI, the factor bywhich the retail prices index has increased over the period in question shallbe treated as nil., 
If, in relation to any period, the figure determined in accordance with theformula would be a figure having more than 3 decimal places, round it to thenearest third decimal place., 
  * _Step Four_, 
Find the relevant factor for each period identified in step two., 
This is a figure expressed as a decimal and determined by the formula—, 
[![Formula - 1 plus \(0.05 multiplied by \(M divided by 12\) plusr](/ukpga/2004/12/images/ukpga_20040012_en_098)](/ukpga/2004/12/images/ukpga_20040012_en_098?view=plain), 
    * where—, 
      * m is the number of months in the period in question (treating part of a month as a whole month), and, 
      * r is the factor by which the retail prices index has increased over the period in question, determined under step three., 
If, in relation to any period, the figure determined in accordance with theformula would have more than 3 decimal places, round it to the nearest thirddecimal place., 
  * _Step Five_, 
Find the uplift factor for the reference period as follows., 
If there is only one period identified in step two, the uplift factor for thereference period is the relevant factor for that period., 
If there are only two periods identified in step two, the uplift factor forthe reference period is calculated by multiplying the relevant factors forthose periods., 
If there are more than two periods identified in step two, the uplift factorfor the reference period is calculated by—, 
(a), 
multiplying the relevant factors for the first two periods,, 
(b), 
multiplying the result by the relevant factor for the next period,, 
(c), 
if there are further periods, multiplying the result by the relevant factorfor the next period,, 
until all periods have been taken into account., 
If the uplift factor for the reference period would be a figure having morethan 3 decimal places, round it to the nearest third decimal place., 
  * _Step Six_, 
The rent increase is regarded as abnormal if the new rent is greater than:, 
R × UF, 
where—, 
    * R is the rent previously taxed (see paragraph 14(4)), and, 
    * UF is the uplift factor for the reference period., 
###### Reduction of rent or term, 
15A(1)Where a lease is varied so as to reduce the amount of the rent, thevariation is treated for the purposes of this Part as an acquisition of achargeable interest by the lessee.,

Identify the relevant owner or owners., 
A person is a relevant owner if—, 
(a), 
immediately after the transaction, he is entitled to a proportion of thechargeable interest, and, 
(b), 
immediately before the transaction, he was a partner or connected with apartner.,

(4)The relevant chargeable interest is—, 
(a)the chargeable interest which ceases to be partnership property as a resultof the transaction to which paragraph 18 applies, or, 
(b)where the transaction to which paragraph 18 applies is the grant orcreation of a chargeable interest, the chargeable interest out of which thatinterest is granted or created.,

(a), 
if the partner was a partner on 19th October 2003, is that date;, 
(b), 
if the partner became a partner after that date, is the date on which hebecame a partner., 
In a case falling within paragraph 21(2)(b), the relevant date—, 
(a),

(a), 
occur in the period starting on the day after the relevant date and endingimmediately before the transaction to which paragraph 18 applies, and, 
(b), 
count for this purpose.,

  * _Step Three_, 
Deduct from the increased partnership share any decreases in the partner’spartnership share which occur in the period starting on the day after therelevant date and ending immediately before the transaction to which paragraph18 applies., 
The result is the partnership share attributable to the partner., 
(2)If the effect of applying Step Three would be to reduce the partnershipshare attributable to the partner below zero, the partnership shareattributable to the partner is zero., 
(3)In a case falling within paragraph 21(2)(a), if the partner ceased to be apartner before 19th October 2003, the partnership share attributable to thepartner is zero.,
