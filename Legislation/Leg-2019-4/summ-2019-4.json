    "general": "This law makes it illegal for landlords and letting agents to ask tenants to pay certain fees, like a fee to sign a lease or a fee to end a lease early. It also says that landlords and letting agents must use a special type of bank account called a \"client money protection scheme\" to protect tenants' money. This law is meant to help tenants avoid being charged unfair fees and to make sure their money is safe.",

    "summary": "\nThe Tenant Fees Act 2019 is a law that helps protect tenants from being charged unfair fees by landlords and letting agents. Here's what the law does:\n\n* It says that landlords and letting agents can't charge tenants certain fees, like fees for credit checks and fees for renewing a tenancy. This means that tenants won't have to pay extra costs just to rent a place to live.\n* The law created a new group called the \"lead enforcement authority\" to make sure that landlords and letting agents follow the rules. This group will check if they are charging tenants the right amount and if they are following the law.\n* The law also changed some old laws so that they now fall under the new enforcement body. This means that more people will be able to enforce the rules and keep landlords and letting agents from charging tenants unfair fees.\n* The law has special powers to help enforce the rules and make sure that everyone follows them. It also sets out when and how the law will start working.\n\nOverall, the Tenant Fees Act 2019 is there to protect tenants from being charged unfair fees and to make sure that landlords and letting agents follow the rules."
