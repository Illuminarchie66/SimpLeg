It makes sure that people who want to catch fish or grow them in the water (called \"aquaculture\") do so in a way that doesn't harm the environment or other creatures living in the sea. The law also says that the government agency in charge of managing the sea (called the \"Marine Management Organisation\") should look after the health of the sea and its creatures. This means they will make sure that people are not polluting the sea or overfishing, which can hurt the environment and the fish.",

    "summary": "The Fisheries Act 2020 helps protect marine life and ensures sustainable fishing practices for future generations. It encourages responsible fishing methods, reduces wasteful catches, and supports coastal communities. This law requires scientists to share data and managers to base decisions on the best research. It also provides financial aid to help fishermen adapt to new rules and technologies. By following these guidelines, we can preserve our seas' biodiversity and guarantee a steady supply of seafood for years to come."
