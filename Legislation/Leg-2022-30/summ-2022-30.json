    "summary": "The Building Safety Act 2022 is a law that aims to improve the safety of people in and around buildings. It introduces a new building safety regulator and sets out clear responsibilities for those involved in the design, construction, and management of buildings. The Act also increases penalties for non-compliance with building safety regulations, and expands the scope of the existing building safety regime to cover all types of buildings. This means that building owners and managers will have to take more responsibility for ensuring the safety of their properties, and there will be tougher consequences for those who fail to comply with the regulations. Overall, the Act aims to provide comprehensive protection for people in and around buildings, and to reduce the risk of major incidents such as fires or collapses."
