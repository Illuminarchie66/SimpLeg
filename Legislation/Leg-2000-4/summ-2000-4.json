It says that if someone in the army, air force, or navy breaks the rules, they can be put in jail or given a punishment. The person who broke the rules has the right to choose whether they want to have a trial in front of a judge or not. If they do choose to have a trial, they can appeal (ask for a review) of the decision made by the judge. This law helps make sure that people in the armed forces are treated fairly when they break the rules.",

If at any time the commanding officer of a person who is kept in military custody without being charged becomes aware that the grounds for keeping that person in military custody have ceased to apply, it shall be the duty of the commanding officer, subject to subsection (3) below, to order his immediate release from military custody.\n* Authorization of custody without charge: Where a person is arrested under section 74 of this Act, the arrest, and any grounds on which he is being kept in military custody without being charged, shall be reported as soon as practicable to his commanding officer. Until such a report is made, the person may be kept in military custody without being charged, but only if the person who made the arrest has reasonable grounds for believing that keeping him in military custody without charge is necessary to secure or preserve evidence relating to an offence for which he is under arrest or to obtain such evidence by questioning him. After receiving a report under subsection (1) above, the commanding officer shall as soon as practicable determine whether the requirements of subsection (4) below are satisfied, and if so, whether to exercise his powers under that subsection; and the person to whom the report relates may be kept in military custody for such period as is necessary to enable the commanding officer to make that determination.\n* Review of custody by commanding officer: The commanding officer of a person kept in military custody in accordance with section 75A of this Act shall, subject to subsection (3) below, review the keeping of that person in military custody not later than the end of the period for which it is authorized. Subsections (4) and (5) of section 75A of this Act shall apply on each review under this section as they apply where a report is received under subsection (1) of that section.\n* Extension of custody without charge: If, on an application by the commanding officer of a person arrested under section 74 of this Act, a judicial officer is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the continued keeping of that person in military custody is justified, the judicial officer may by order authorize the keeping of that person in military custody.\n* Other cases: Sections 75 to 75C of this Act apply where a person is delivered into military custody under section 187(2) or (3), 188(2) or 190A(3) of this Act or under Schedule 2 to the Reserve Forces Act 1996, and in any other case where a person arrested by a constable is delivered into military custody, as they apply where a person is arrested under section 74 of this Act, subject to such modifications as the Secretary of State may by regulations made by statutory instrument prescribe."
