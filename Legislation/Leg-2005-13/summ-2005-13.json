    "summary": "The Disability Discrimination Act of 2005 safeguards the rights of persons with disabilities in the United Kingdom, particularly in the realm of rental properties. The law mandates that landlords make reasonable modifications to their homes to facilitate access for individuals with disabilities. This entails supplying auxiliary aids or services like installing ramps or providing sign language interpreters. Furthermore, landlords are required to remove or modify physical barriers that restrict accessibility. Failure to abide by these responsibilities might result in legal repercussions. The law covers all rental properties within the United Kingdom and applies to both the tenant and any other individual who may be affected by the request for reasonable adjustments. However, there are specific exceptions to the rule, such as when the premises are the owner's primary residence and they do not employ an estate agent. Overall, the Disability Discrimination Act of 2005 seeks to guarantee equal access to rental properties for individuals with disabilities, thereby promoting inclusivity and combating discrimination."
