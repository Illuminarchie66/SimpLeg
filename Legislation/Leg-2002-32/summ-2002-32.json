    "summary": "The Education Act of 2002 gives teachers more freedom to work across different schools while keeping their employment rights. It sets up a system for evaluating teacher performance and requires teachers to meet certain standards to keep their jobs. The government can make rules about physical activity in schools and decide which qualifications, courses, programs, or institutions are acceptable for getting knowledge. This law also changes some rules about how teachers get paid and how their pensions work."
