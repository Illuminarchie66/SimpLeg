    "summary": "The Appropriation (No. 2) Act 2007 is a law that gives permission for the British government to spend money for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2008. It sets limits on how much can be spent and divides the spending into different areas like education, healthcare, defense, foreign affairs, and development assistance. For example, the law says that the department of education and skills can spend up to \u00a362 billion, while the ministry of defense can spend up to \u00a334 billion. Additionally, the law requires that any additional spending beyond what's already planned must be approved before August 12th. Overall, the law helps ensure that the government stays within its budget and prioritizes its spending based on national needs and priorities."
