##### CHAPTER 2Treatment of relevant step for income tax purposes, 
###### Employment income, 
###### 554Z2Value of relevant step to count as employment income, 
(1)If this Chapter applies by reason of a relevant step, the value of therelevant step (see section 554Z3) counts as employment income of A in respectof A’s employment with B—, 
(a)if the relevant step is taken before A’s employment with B starts, for thetax year in which the employment starts, or, 
(b)otherwise, for the tax year in which the relevant step is taken., 
(2)If the relevant step gives rise to—, 
(a)an amount which (apart from this subsection) would be treated as earningsof A under a provision of the benefits code, or, 
(b)any income of A which (apart from this subsection) would be dealt withunder Chapter 3 of Part 4 of ITTOIA 2005,, 
subsection (1) applies instead of that provision of the benefits code orChapter 3 of Part 4 of ITTOIA 2005 (as the case may be)., 
(3)In particular, in a case in which the relevant step is the making of anemployment-related loan (within the meaning of Chapter 7 of Part 3), theeffect of subsection (2)(a) is that the loan is not to be treated for any taxyear as a taxable cheap loan for the purposes of that Chapter., 
###### 554Z3Value of relevant step, 
(1)If the relevant step involves a sum of money, its value is the amount ofthe sum., 
(2)In any other case, the value of the relevant step is—, 
(a)the market value when the relevant step is taken of the asset which is thesubject of the step, or, 
(b)if higher, the cost of the relevant step., 
(3)Subsection (2)(a) is subject to sections 437 and 452., 
(4)Subsection (2)(b) is to be ignored if—, 
(a)the relevant step is within section 554C(1)(c), and, 
(b)any of Chapters 2 to 4A of Part 7 apply by virtue of the acquisition., 
(5)Subsection (2)(b) is also to be ignored if section 554Z7 applies., 
(6)In subsection (2)(b) the reference to the cost of the relevant step is tothe expense incurred in connection with the relevant step (including a properproportion of any expense relating partly to the relevant step and partly toother matters) by the person or persons at whose cost the relevant step istaken., 
(7)Subsections (1) and (2) are subject to sections 554Z4, 554Z5, 554Z6, 554Z7and 554Z8, which, so far as applicable, are to be applied in that order., 
###### 554Z4Residence issues, 
(1)After the value of the relevant step is determined under section 554Z3, theparticular tax year or years which the value of the relevant step is “for” areto be determined., 
(2)For this purpose, apply sections 16(1) to (4) and 17(1) to (3) as if thevalue of the relevant step were general earnings., 
(3)Subsection (4) applies if the value of the relevant step, or a part of it,is “for” a tax year in which A is non-UK resident., 
(4)The value, or the part of it, is to be reduced so far as it is not inrespect of duties performed in the United Kingdom., 
(5)The question of the extent to which the value, or the part of it, is not inrespect of duties performed in the United Kingdom is to be determined on ajust and reasonable basis., 
(6)This section does not change the tax year for which the value of therelevant step counts as employment income under section 554Z2(1)., 
###### 554Z5Overlap with earlier relevant step, 
(1)This section applies if there is overlap between—, 
(a)the sum of money or asset (“sum or asset P”) which is the subject of therelevant step, and, 
(b)the sum of money or asset (“sum or asset Q”) which was the subject of anearlier relevant step (“the earlier relevant step”) by reason of which thisChapter applied in respect of A’s employment with B., 
(2)The value of the relevant step (after any reductions under section 554Z4)is reduced (but not below nil)—, 
(a)if the overlap covers the whole of sum or asset Q, by the value of theearlier relevant step, or, 
(b)if the overlap covers only part of sum or asset Q, by the part of the valueof the earlier relevant step which corresponds to the part of sum or asset Qcovered by the overlap as determined on a just and reasonable basis., 
(3)In subsection (2) references to the value of the earlier relevant step areto that value—, 
(a)after any reductions made to it under section 554Z4 or this section orsection 554Z7, but, 
(b)before any reductions made to it under section 554Z6 or 554Z8., 
(4)For the purposes of this section there is overlap between sum or asset Pand sum or asset Q so far as—, 
(a)they are the same sum of money or asset, or, 
(b)sum or asset P, essentially, replaces sum or asset Q., 
(5)Further, if any reductions were made under this section to the value of theearlier relevant step, sum or asset P is treated as overlapping with any othersum of money or asset so far as the other sum of money or asset was treated asoverlapping with sum or asset Q for the purposes of this section., 
###### 554Z6Overlap with certain earnings, 
(1)This section applies if the relevant step gives rise to relevant earningsof A from A’s employment with B—, 
(a)which are, in accordance with section 16 and (if applicable) section 17,“for” a tax year in which A is UK resident, or, 
(b)which are, in accordance with section 29 and (if applicable) section 30,“for” a tax year in which A is non-UK resident but which are in respect ofduties performed in the United Kingdom for the purposes of section 27(1)(a).,

(a)earnings within Chapter 1 of Part 3,, 
(b)amounts treated as earnings under Chapter 12 of Part 3, and,

(g)there is no connection (direct or indirect) between the relevant step and atax avoidance arrangement., 
(2)Subsection (3) also applies if—, 
(a)the relevant step is a step treated as being taken by section 554L(9) or554M(8), and, 
(b)in order to exercise the relevant share option to which the step relates soas—,

(ii)two or more such disposals,, 
(b)either—, 
(i)subsection (3B) applies to the disposal or, if there is more than onedisposal, to at least one of them, or, 
(ii)sub-paragraph (i) does not apply but had subsection (3B) applied to thedisposal or, if there is more than one disposal, to each of them, any gainarising on the disposal or disposals would not have been a chargeable gain byvirtue of Schedule 7AC, and,

(i)as if an amount equal to the amount of the gain were excluded from theexpenditure allowable as a deduction under section 38 in the computation ofthe gain or loss accruing on the disposal (but not so as to reduce thatexpenditure below nil), and,

(b)where an allowable loss would accrue to company A in the absence ofsubsection (3A), as if an amount equal to the amount of the loss were a sumallowable under section 38 as a deduction in the computation of the gain orloss accruing on the disposal., 
In this subsection “new holding” has the meaning given by section 126., 
(3F)If there is more than one group disposal, the references in subsections(3D) and (3E) to the amount of the gain or loss which would accrue to companyA in the absence of subsection (3A) are to be read, in relation to eachdisposal, as references to—, 
(a)such proportion of that amount as the transferor companies in relation tothe group disposals jointly elect as the appropriate proportion in relation tothe disposal in question, or, 
(b)where no election is made, the proportion of that amount attributable tothat disposal if that amount is divided equally between the group disposals.,
