    "summary": "Hello! This law is about making sure that taxi and private hire vehicle drivers help disabled people more. Before, some drivers might not have helped or charged extra for doing so. Now, all drivers must help disabled people get in and out of their vehicles and take their mobility aids like wheelchairs without any extra cost. They also can't say no to taking disabled people as customers just because they are disabled. If a driver doesn't follow these rules, they could get in trouble with the law and pay a fine of up to \u00a31,000. This law applies to England, Wales, and Scotland and starts working two months after it was made. So, if you are a disabled person who needs help getting around, you should be able to use taxis and private hire vehicles more easily now!",
