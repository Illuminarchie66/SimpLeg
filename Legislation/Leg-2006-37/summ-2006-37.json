    "general": "The Parliamentary Costs Act 2006 is a law that helps regulate how much money members of Parliament can spend on legal costs when they are involved in court cases or other legal matters related to their work as MPs. It brings together several older laws that dealt with these issues and makes some changes based on suggestions from the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission. The goal of the law is to make sure that MPs are responsible stewards of public funds and that taxpayers' money is used wisely.",

    "summary": "The Parliamentary Costs Act 2006 regulates the expenses of representatives involved in private bills in the UK Parliament. The law specifies who can charge for what and how much. To ensure fairness, a taxing officer will review the charges and make sure they comply with the law. If there's a dispute about the charges, the taxing officer will investigate and make a final decision. The law also sets out rules for awarding costs if one side acts unfairly, like wasting time or money. These rules aim to encourage fair play and prevent abuse of the system. Overall, the law helps ensure that private bills are processed fairly and efficiently, protecting the public interest and avoiding unnecessary delays or expenses."
