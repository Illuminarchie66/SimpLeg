    "summary": "The Private Security Industry Act of 2001 regulates the private security industry in the UK. The Security Industry Authority (SIA) is responsible for issuing licenses, setting standards, and enforcing regulations. To work in the industry, you need a license, which involves a background check and proof of competence. The SIA can revoke licenses if the holder violates the rules or engages in unacceptable behavior. Local authorities may assist with licensing functions. The Act established a register of approved providers and gave authorities the power to inspect and investigate suspected unlicensed activities. Those found guilty of obstructing these powers or making false statements could face fines and imprisonment. The Act also grants the Secretary of State order-making powers to modify regulations and define terms used in the Act."
