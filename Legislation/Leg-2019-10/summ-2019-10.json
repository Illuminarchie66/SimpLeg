    "general": "This law makes it easier for courts to help girls who have been hurt by female genital mutilation (FGM). FGM is when someone cuts or changes a girl's body parts to try to make her a woman. This law says that if a court needs to get involved to protect a girl from FGM, they can use the same rules as if they were helping a lost child find their parents. This will make it easier for the court to help the girl and keep her safe.",
