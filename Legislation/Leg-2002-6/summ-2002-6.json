The original law, passed in 1997, gave these groups an amnesty until 2003, but this new law extended that deadline to give them more time to decommission their arms safely. This was done to help bring peace to the region and reduce violence between different political groups.",

This law gives them extra time until February 27, 2007, to safely give up their weapons. It also ensures that any plans already made to get rid of weapons will still count as proper decommissioning, even if the law doesn't go into effect until later. This helps keep everyone safe and promotes peace in Northern Ireland.",
