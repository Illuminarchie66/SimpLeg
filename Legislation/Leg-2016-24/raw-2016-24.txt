(1)This section applies for the purposes of determining the relevant IPprofits of a trade of a company for an accounting period in a case where—, 
(a)the accounting period begins on or after 1 July 2021, or, 
(b)the company is a new entrant (see section 357A(11))., 
(2)To determine the relevant IP profits—, 
  * _Step 1_, 
Take any amounts which are brought into account as credits in calculating theprofits of the trade for the accounting period, other than any amounts offinance income (see section 357BG), and divide them into two “streams”,amounts of relevant IP income (see sections 357BH to 357BHC) and amounts thatare not amounts of relevant IP income., 
The stream consisting of relevant IP income is “the relevant IP incomestream”; the other stream is the “standard income stream”., 
  * _Step 2_, 
Divide the relevant IP income stream into “relevant IP income sub-streams” sothat each sub-stream is—, 
(a), 
a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to a particularqualifying IP right (an “individual IP right sub-stream”),, 
(b), 
a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to a particular kindof IP item (a “product sub-stream”), or, 
(c), 
a sub-stream consisting of income properly attributable to a particular kindof IP process (a “process sub-stream”)., 
See subsection (5) for the meaning of “IP item” and “IP process” and seesubsections (6) and (7) for further provision in connection with product sub-streams and process sub-streams., 
  * _Step 3_, 
Take any amounts which are brought into account as debits in calculating theprofits of the trade for the accounting period, other than any excluded debits(see section 357BI), and allocate them on a just and reasonable basis betweenthe standard income stream and each of the relevant IP income sub-streams., 
  * _Step 4_, 
Deduct from each relevant IP income sub-stream—, 
(a), 
the amounts allocated to the sub-stream at Step 3, and, 
(b), 
the routine return figure for the sub-stream (see section 357BJ)., 
But see section 357BIA (which provides that certain amounts allocated to arelevant IP income sub-stream at Step 3 are not to be deducted from the sub-stream at this Step)., 
  * _Step 5_, 
Deduct from each relevant IP income sub-stream which is greater than nilfollowing Step 4 the marketing assets return figure for the sub-stream (seesection 357BK)., 
  * _Step 6_, 
Multiply the amount of each relevant IP income sub-stream (following thedeductions required at Steps 4 and 5) by the R&D fraction for the sub-stream(see section 357BL)., 
  * _Step 7_, 
Add together the amounts of the relevant IP income sub-streams (following Step6)., 
  * _Step 8_, 
If the company has made an election under section 357BM (which provides incertain circumstances for profits arising before the grant of a right to betreated as relevant IP profits), add to the amount given by Step 7 any amountdetermined in accordance with subsection (3) of that section., 
(3)If the amount given by subsection (2) is greater than nil, that amount isthe relevant IP profits of the trade for the accounting period., 
(4)If the amount given by subsection (2) is less than nil, that amount is therelevant IP losses of the trade for the accounting period (see Chapter 5)., 
(5)In this section—, 
  * “IP item” means—, 
(a), 
an item in respect of which a qualifying IP right held by the company has beengranted, or, 
(b), 
an item which incorporates one or more items within paragraph (a);, 
  * “IP process” means—, 
(a), 
a process in respect of which a qualifying IP right held by the company hasbeen granted, or, 
(b), 
a process which incorporates one or more processes within paragraph (a)., 
(6)For the purposes of this section two or more IP items, or two or more IPprocesses, may be treated as being of a particular kind if they are intendedto be, or are capable of being, used for the same or substantially the samepurposes., 
(7)Income may be allocated at Step 2 of subsection (2) to a product sub-streamor process sub-stream only if—, 
(a)it would not be reasonably practicable to apportion the income betweenindividual IP right sub-streams, or, 
(b)it would be reasonably practicable to do that but doing so would result init not being reasonably practicable to apply any of the remaining steps insubsection (2).,

(1)In this Part “payment” means any transfer—, 
(a)of money or money’s worth directly or indirectly from one person (“thepayer”) to one or more other persons, and, 
(b)in relation to which (disregarding this Part and any equivalent provisionunder the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom) an amount (a“relevant deduction”) may be deducted from the payer’s income for a taxableperiod (the “payment period”) for the purposes of calculating the payer’staxable profits., 
(2)For the purposes of this Part, there is a “quasi-payment”, in relation to ataxable period (the “payment period”) of a person (“the payer”), if(disregarding this Part and any equivalent provision under the law of aterritory outside the United Kingdom)—, 
(a)an amount (a “relevant deduction”) may be deducted from the payer’s incomefor that period for the purposes of calculating the payer’s taxable profits,and, 
(b)making the assumptions in subsection (4), it would be reasonable to expectan amount of ordinary income to arise to one or more other persons as a resultof the circumstances giving rise to the relevant deduction., 
(3)But a quasi-payment does not arise under subsection (2) if—, 
(a)the relevant deduction is an amount that is deemed, under the law of thepayer jurisdiction, to arise for tax purposes, and, 
(b)the circumstances giving rise to the relevant deduction do not include anyeconomic rights, in substance, existing between the payer and a personmentioned in subsection (2)(b)., 
(4)The assumptions are that (so far as would not otherwise be the case)—, 
(a)any question as to whether an entity is a distinct and separate person fromthe payer is determined in accordance with the law of the payer jurisdiction,, 
(b)any persons to whom amounts arise, or potentially arise, as a result of thecircumstances giving rise to the relevant deduction adopt the same approach toaccounting for those circumstances as the payer, and, 
(c)any persons to whom amounts arise, or potentially arise, as a result ofthose circumstances—, 
(i)are, under the law of the payer jurisdiction, resident in that jurisdictionfor tax purposes, and,

(b)references to a quasi-payment being made are to those circumstancesarising., 
(6)In this Part “payee” means—, 
(a)in the case of a payment, any person—, 
(i)to whom the transfer is made as mentioned in subsection (1)(a), or, 
(ii)to whom an amount of ordinary income arises as a result of the payment,and, 
(b)in the case of a quasi-payment, any person—, 
(i)to whom it would be reasonable to expect an amount of ordinary income toarise as mentioned in subsection (2)(b), or, 
(ii)to whom an amount of ordinary income arises as a result of the quasi-payment., 
(7)For the purposes of this Part, in the case of a quasi-payment, the payer is“also a payee” if—, 
(a)an entity is not a distinct and separate person from the payer for thepurposes of a tax charged under the law of the United Kingdom,, 
(b)that entity is a distinct and separate person from the payer for thepurposes of a tax charged under the law of the payer jurisdiction, and,

###### Ordinary income, 
###### 259BCThe basic rules, 
(1)This section has effect for the purposes of this Part., 
(2)“Ordinary income” means income that is brought into account, before anydeductions, for the purposes of calculating the income or profits on which arelevant tax is charged (“taxable profits”)., 
(3)But an amount of income is not brought into account for those purposes tothe extent that it is excluded, reduced or offset by any exemption, exclusion,relief or credit—, 
(a)that applies specifically to all or part of the amount of income (asopposed to ordinary income generally), or, 
(b)that arises as a result of, or otherwise in connection with, a payment orquasi-payment that gives rise to the amount of income., 
(4)If all the relevant tax charged on taxable profits is, or falls to be,refunded, none of the income brought into account in calculating those taxableprofits is “ordinary income”., 
(5)If a proportion of the relevant tax charged on taxable profits is, or fallsto be, refunded, the amount of any income brought into account in calculatingthose taxable profits that is “ordinary income” is proportionally reduced., 
(6)For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) an amount of relevant tax isrefunded if and to the extent that—, 
(a)any repayment of relevant tax, or any payment in respect of a credit forrelevant tax, is made to any person, and, 
(b)that repayment or payment is directly or indirectly in respect of the wholeor part of the amount of relevant tax,, 
but an amount refunded is to be ignored if and to the extent that it resultsfrom qualifying loss relief., 
(7)In subsection (6) “qualifying loss relief” means—, 
(a)any means by which a loss might be used for corporation tax or income taxpurposes to reduce the amount in respect of which a person is liable to tax,or, 
(b)any corresponding means by which a loss corresponding to a relevant taxloss might be used for the purposes of a relevant tax other than corporationtax or income tax to reduce the amount in respect of which a person is liableto tax,, 
(and in paragraph (b) “relevant tax loss” means a loss that might be used asmentioned in paragraph (a))., 
(8)References to an amount of ordinary income being “included in” taxableprofits are to that amount being brought into account for the purposes ofcalculating those profits., 
(9)In this section “relevant tax” means a tax other than the CFC charge or aforeign CFC charge., 
(10)Section 259BD contains provision for ordinary income to arise tochargeable companies by virtue of the CFC charge or a foreign CFC charge., 
###### 259BDChargeable companies in respect of CFCs and foreign CFCs, 
(1)This section has effect for the purposes of this Part., 
(2)Subsections (3) to (7) apply where an amount of income arises to an entity(“C”) that is a CFC, a foreign CFC or both and all or part of that amount (the“relevant income”)—, 
(a)is not ordinary income of C under section 259BC, or, 
(b)arises as a result of a payment or quasi-payment under, or in connectionwith, a financial instrument or hybrid transfer arrangement and—, 
(i)is (disregarding subsection (4)) ordinary income of C under section 259BCfor a taxable period, but, 
(ii)under taxed., 
(3)The following steps determine whether, and to what extent, the relevantincome is “ordinary income” of a chargeable company in relation to the CFCcharge or a foreign CFC charge., 
  * _Step 1_, 
Determine—, 
(a), 
whether any of the relevant income is brought into account in calculating C’schargeable profits for the purposes of the CFC charge or a foreign CFC charge,and, 
(b), 
if so, the amount of the relevant income that is so brought into account forthe purposes of each relevant charge., 
If none of the relevant income is so brought into account, then none of it is“ordinary income” of a chargeable company and no further steps are to betaken., 
See subsections (10) to (12) for further provision about how this step is tobe taken., 
For the purposes of this section—, 
    * “relevant chargeable profits” are chargeable profits in relation to the calculation of which, for the purposes of the CFC charge or a foreign CFC charge, any of the relevant income is brought into account;, 
    * “relevant charge” means a charge in relation to which any of the relevant income is brought into account in calculating chargeable profits., 
  * _Step 2_, 
In relation to each relevant charge, determine the proportion of C’s relevantchargeable profits, for the purposes of that charge, that is apportioned toeach chargeable company., 
For the purposes of this section, each chargeable company to which 25% or moreof C’s relevant chargeable profits for the purposes of a relevant charge areapportioned is a “relevant chargeable company”., 
If there are no relevant chargeable companies in relation to any relevantcharges, then none of the relevant income is “ordinary income” of a chargeablecompany and no further steps are to be taken., 
  * _Step 3_, 
In relation to each relevant chargeable company, determine what is theappropriate proportion of the relevant income brought into account incalculating relevant chargeable profits, for the purposes of the relevantcharge concerned., 
That proportion of that income is “ordinary income” of that company for thetaxable period for which that charge is charged on it by reference to thoseprofits., 
For the purposes of this step, the “appropriate proportion”, in relation to arelevant chargeable company, is the same as the proportion of the relevantchargeable profits that is apportioned to it for the purposes of the relevantcharge., 
(4)An amount of relevant income that is ordinary income of a relevantchargeable company in accordance with subsection (3) is not ordinary income ofC (so far as it otherwise would be)., 
(5)Relevant chargeable profits apportioned to a relevant chargeable companyfor the purposes of a relevant charge are “taxable profits” of that companyfor the taxable period for which the charge is charged on it by reference tothose profits., 
(6)The amount of the relevant income that is ordinary income of that relevantchargeable company under subsection (3), by virtue of being brought intoaccount in calculating those relevant chargeable profits, is “included in”those taxable profits., 
(7)References to tax charged on taxable profits include a relevant chargecharged by reference to relevant chargeable profits that are taxable profitsunder subsection (5)., 
(8)For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), an amount of ordinary income is“under taxed” if the highest rate at which tax is charged, for C’s taxableperiod, on the taxable profits in which the amount is included, taking intoaccount on a just and reasonable basis any credit for underlying tax, is lessthan C’s full marginal rate for that period., 
(9)In subsection (8)—, 
(a)C’s “full marginal rate” means the highest rate at which the tax that ischargeable on those taxable profits could be charged on taxable profits, of Cfor the taxable period, which include ordinary income that arises from, or inconnection with, a financial instrument, and, 
(b)“credit for underlying tax” means a credit or relief given to reflect taxcharged on profits that are wholly or partly used to fund (directly orindirectly) the payment or quasi-payment mentioned in subsection (2)(b)., 
(10)For the purposes of step 1 in subsection (3), section 259BC(3) applies forthe purposes of determining the extent to which an amount of relevant incomeis brought into account in calculating chargeable profits as it applies forthe purposes of determining the extent to which an amount of income is broughtinto account for the purposes of calculating taxable profits., 
(11)Subsection (12) applies for the purposes of step 1 in subsection (3), if—, 
(a)the amount of income arising to C mentioned in subsection (2)—, 
(i)is not all relevant income, and, 
(ii)is only partly brought into account in calculating chargeable profits forthe purposes of the CFC charge or a foreign CFC charge, and, 
(b)accordingly, it falls to be determined whether, and to what extent, therelevant income is brought into account in calculating those profits for thepurposes of the charge concerned., 
(12)The relevant income is to be taken to be brought into account (if at all)only to the extent that the total amount of income mentioned in subsection (2)that is brought into account exceeds the amount of income mentioned in thatsubsection that is not relevant income., 
(13)In this section—, 
  * “chargeable company”—, 
(a), 
in relation to the CFC charge, has the same meaning as in Part 9A (see section371VA), and, 
(b), 
in relation to a foreign CFC charge, means an entity (by whatever name known)corresponding to a chargeable company within the meaning of that Part;, 
  * “chargeable profits”—, 
(a), 
in relation to the CFC charge, has the same meaning as in that Part (see thatsection), and, 
(b), 
in relation to a foreign CFC charge, means the concept (by whatever nameknown) corresponding to chargeable profits within the meaning of that Part;, 
  * “hybrid transfer arrangement” has the meaning given by section 259DB., 
###### Hybrid entity etc,

(b)under the law of a territory other than the one mentioned in subsection(2), the entity is not regarded as a distinct and separate person to an entityor entities that are distinct and separate persons under the law of theterritory mentioned in that subsection., 
(4)For the purposes of this Part—, 
(a)where subsection (3)(a) applies, a person who is treated as having theincome or profits of the hybrid entity is an “investor” in it,, 
(b)where subsection (3)(b) applies, an entity that—, 
(i)is regarded as a distinct and separate person to the hybrid entity underthe law of the territory mentioned in subsection (2), but, 
(ii)is not regarded as a distinct and separate person to the hybrid entityunder the law of another territory,, 
is an “investor” in the hybrid entity, and, 
(c)any territory under the law of which an investor is within the charge to atax is an “investor jurisdiction” in relation to that investor.,

##### CHAPTER 3Hybrid and other mismatches from financial instruments, 
###### Introduction, 
###### 259COverview of Chapter,

###### Application of Chapter, 
###### 259CACircumstances in which the Chapter applies, 
(1)This Chapter applies if conditions A to D are met., 
(2)Condition A is that a payment or quasi-payment is made under, or inconnection with, a financial instrument., 
(3)Condition B is that—, 
(a)the payer is within the charge to corporation tax for the payment period,or, 
(b)a payee is within the charge to corporation tax for an accounting periodsome or all of which falls within the payment period., 
(4)Condition C is that it is reasonable to suppose that, disregarding theprovisions mentioned in subsection (5), there would be a hybrid or otherwiseimpermissible deduction/non-inclusion mismatch in relation to the payment orquasi-payment (see section 259CB)., 
(5)The provisions are—, 
(a)this Chapter and Chapters 5 to 10, and, 
(b)any equivalent provision under the law of a territory outside the UnitedKingdom., 
(6)Condition D is that—, 
(a)it is a quasi-payment that is made as mentioned in subsection (2) and thepayer is also a payee (see section 259BB(7)),, 
(b)the payer and a payee are related (see section 259NC) at any time in theperiod—, 
(i)beginning with the day on which any arrangement is made by the payer or apayee in connection with the financial instrument, and, 
(ii)ending with the last day of the payment period, or, 
(c)the financial instrument, or any arrangement connected with it, is astructured arrangement., 
(7)The financial instrument, or an arrangement connected with it, is a“structured arrangement” if it is reasonable to suppose that—, 
(a)the financial instrument, or arrangement, is designed to secure a hybrid orotherwise impermissible deduction/non-inclusion mismatch, or, 
(b)the terms of the financial instrument or arrangement share the economicbenefit of the mismatch between the parties to the instrument or arrangementor otherwise reflect the fact that the mismatch is expected to arise., 
(8)The financial instrument or arrangement may be designed to secure a hybridor otherwise impermissible deduction/non-inclusion mismatch despite also beingdesigned to secure any commercial or other objective., 
(9)Sections 259CD (cases where the payer is within the charge to corporationtax for the payment period) and 259CE (cases where a payee is within thecharge to corporation tax) contain provision for the counteraction of thehybrid or otherwise impermissible deduction/non-inclusion mismatch., 
###### 259CBHybrid or otherwise impermissible deduction/non-inclusionmismatches and their extent, 
(1)There is a “hybrid or otherwise impermissible deduction/non-inclusionmismatch”, in relation to a payment or quasi-payment, if either or both ofcase 1 or 2 applies., 
(2)Case 1 applies where—, 
(a)the relevant deduction exceeds the sum of the amounts of ordinary incomethat, by reason of the payment or quasi-payment, arise to each payee for apermitted taxable period, and, 
(b)all or part of that excess arises by reason of the terms, or any otherfeature, of the financial instrument., 
(3)So far as the excess arises by reason of a relevant debt relief provision,it is to be taken not to arise by reason of the terms, or any other feature,of the financial instrument (whether or not it would have arisen by reason ofthe terms, or any other feature, of the financial instrument regardless of therelevant debt relief provision)., 
(4)Subject to that and subsection (9), for the purposes of subsection (2)(b)—, 
(a)it does not matter whether the excess or part arises for another reason aswell as the terms, or any other feature, of the financial instrument (even ifit would have arisen for that other reason regardless of the terms, or anyother feature, of the financial instrument), and, 
(b)an excess or part of an excess is to be taken to arise by reason of theterms, or any other feature, of the financial instrument (so far as would nototherwise be the case) if, on making such of the relevant assumptions inrelation to each payee as apply in relation to that payee (see subsections (5)and (6)), it could arise by reason of the terms, or any other feature, of thefinancial instrument., 
(5)These are the “relevant assumptions”—, 
(a)where a payee is not within the charge to a tax under the law of a payeejurisdiction because the payee benefits from an exclusion, immunity, exemptionor relief (however described) under that law, assume that the exclusion,immunity, exemption or relief does not apply;, 
(b)where an amount of income is not included in the ordinary income of a payeefor the purposes of a tax charged under the law of a payee jurisdictionbecause the payment or quasi-payment is not made in connection with a businesscarried on by the payee in that jurisdiction, assume that the payment orquasi-payment is made in connection with such a business;, 
(c)where a payee is not within the charge to a tax under the law of anyterritory because there is no territory where the payee is—, 
(i)resident for the purposes of a tax charged under the law of that territory,or, 
(ii)within the charge to a tax under the law of that territory as a result ofhaving a permanent establishment in that territory,, 
assume that the payee is a company that is resident for tax purposes, andcarries on a business in connection with which the payment or quasi-payment ismade, in the United Kingdom., 
(6)Where the relevant assumption in subsection (5)(c) applies in relation to apayee the following provisions are to be disregarded in relation to that payeefor the purposes of subsection (4)(b)—, 
(a)section 441 of CTA 2009 (loan relationships for unallowable purposes);, 
(b)section 690 of that Act (derivative contracts for unallowable purposes);, 
(c)Part 4 (transfer pricing);, 
(d)this Part;, 
(e)Part 7 (tax treatment of financing costs and income)., 
(7)Case 2 applies where there are one or more amounts of ordinary income(“under-taxed amounts”) that—, 
(a)arise, by reason of the payment or quasi-payment, to a payee for apermitted taxable period, and, 
(b)are under taxed by reason of the terms, or any other feature, of thefinancial instrument., 
(8)Subject to subsection (9), for the purposes of subsection (7)(b) it doesnot matter whether an amount of ordinary income is under taxed for anotherreason as well as the terms, or any other feature, of the financial instrument(even if it would have been under taxed for that other reason regardless ofthe terms, or any other feature, of the financial instrument)., 
(9)For the purposes of this section disregard—, 
(a)any excess or part of an excess mentioned in subsection (2), and, 
(b)any under-taxed amount,, 
that arises as a result of a payee being a relevant investment fund (seesection 259NA)., 
(10)Where case 1 applies, the amount of the hybrid or otherwise impermissiblededuction/non-inclusion mismatch is equal to the excess that arises asmentioned in subsection (2)(b)., 
(11)Where case 2 applies, the amount of the hybrid or otherwise impermissiblededuction/non-inclusion mismatch is equal to the sum of the amounts given inrespect of each under-taxed amount by—, 
[![](/ukpga/2016/24/images/ukpga_20160024_en_027)](/ukpga/2016/24/images/ukpga_20160024_en_027?view=plain), 
where—, 
  * “UTA” is the under-taxed amount;, 
  * “FMR” is the payee’s full marginal rate (expressed as a percentage) for the permitted taxable period for which the under-taxed amount arises;, 
  * “R” is the highest rate (expressed as a percentage) at which tax is charged on the taxable profits in which the under-taxed amount is included, taking into account on a just and reasonable basis the effect of any credit for underlying tax., 
(12)Where cases 1 and 2 both apply, the amount of the hybrid or otherwiseimpermissible deduction/non-inclusion mismatch is the sum of the amounts givenby subsections (10) and (11)., 
(13)See section 259CC for the meaning of “permitted taxable period”, “relevantdebt relief provision” and “under taxed”., 
###### 259CCInterpretation of section 259CB, 
(1)This section has effect for the purposes of section 259CB., 
(2)A taxable period of a payee is “permitted” in relation to an amount ofordinary income that arises as a result of the payment or quasi-payment if—, 
(a)the period begins before the end of 12 months after the end of the paymentperiod, or, 
(b)where the period begins after that—, 
(i)a claim has been made for the period to be a permitted period in relationto the amount of ordinary income, and, 
(ii)it is just and reasonable for the amount of ordinary income to arise forthat taxable period rather than an earlier period., 
(3)Each of these is a “relevant debt relief provision”—, 
(a)section 322 of CTA 2009 (release of debts: cases where credits not requiredto be brought into account),, 
(b)section 357 of that Act (insolvent creditors),, 
(c)section 358 of that Act (exclusion of credits on release of connectedcompanies’ debts: general),, 
(d)section 359 of that Act (exclusion of credits on release of connectedcompanies’ debts during creditor’s insolvency),, 
(e)section 361C of that Act (the equity-for-debt exception),, 
(f)section 361D of that Act (corporate rescue: debt released shortly afteracquisition), and, 
(g)section 362A of that Act (corporate rescue: debt released shortly afterconnection arises)., 
(4)An amount of ordinary income of a payee, for a permitted taxable period, is“under taxed” if the highest rate at which tax is charged on the taxableprofits of the payee in which the amount is included, taking into account on ajust and reasonable basis the effect of any credit for underlying tax, is lessthan the payee’s full marginal rate for that period., 
(5)The payee’s “full marginal rate” means the highest rate at which the taxthat is chargeable on the taxable profits mentioned in subsection (4) could becharged on taxable profits, of the payee for the permitted taxable period,which include ordinary income that arises from, or in connection with, afinancial instrument., 
(6)A “credit for underlying tax” means a credit or relief given to reflect taxcharged on profits that are wholly or partly used to fund (directly orindirectly) the payment or quasi-payment., 
###### Counteraction, 
###### 259CDCounteraction where the payer is within the charge to corporationtax for the payment period, 
(1)This section applies where the payer is within the charge to corporationtax for the payment period., 
(2)For corporation tax purposes, the relevant deduction that may be deductedfrom the payer’s income for the payment period is reduced by an amount equalto the hybrid or otherwise impermissible deduction/non-inclusion mismatchmentioned in section 259CA(4)., 
###### 259CECounteraction where a payee is within the charge to corporationtax, 
(1)This section applies in relation to a payee where—, 
(a)the payee is within the charge to corporation tax for an accounting periodsome or all of which falls within the payment period, and, 
(b)it is reasonable to suppose that—, 
(i)neither section 259CD nor any equivalent provision under the law of aterritory outside the United Kingdom applies, or, 
(ii)a provision of the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom that isequivalent to section 259CD applies, but does not fully counteract the hybridor otherwise impermissible deduction/non-inclusion mismatch mentioned insection 259CA(4)., 
(2)A provision of the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom that isequivalent to section 259CD does not fully counteract that mismatch if (andonly if)—, 
(a)it does not reduce the relevant deduction by the full amount of themismatch, and, 
(b)the payer is still able to deduct some of the relevant deduction fromincome in calculating taxable profits., 
(3)In this section “the relevant amount” is—, 
(a)in a case where subsection (1)(b)(i) applies, an amount equal to the hybridor otherwise impermissible deduction/non-inclusion mismatch mentioned insection 259CA(4), or, 
(b)in a case where subsection (1)(b)(ii) applies, the lesser of—, 
(i)the amount by which that mismatch exceeds the amount by which it isreasonable to suppose the relevant deduction is reduced by a provision underthe law of a territory outside the United Kingdom that is equivalent tosection 259CD, and, 
(ii)the amount of the relevant deduction that may still be deducted asmentioned in subsection (2)(b)., 
(4)If the payee is the only payee, the relevant amount is to be treated asincome arising to the payee for the counteraction period., 
(5)If there is more than one payee, an amount equal to the payee’s share ofthe relevant amount is to be treated as income arising to the payee for thecounteraction period., 
(6)The payee’s share of the relevant amount is to be determined byapportioning that amount between all the payees on a just and reasonablebasis, having regard (in particular)—, 
(a)to any arrangements as to profit sharing that may exist between some or allof the payees,, 
(b)to whom any under-taxed amounts (within the meaning given by section259CB(7)) arise, and, 
(c)to whom any amounts of ordinary income that it would be reasonable toexpect to arise as a result of the payment or quasi-payment, but that do notarise, would have arisen., 
(7)An amount of income that is treated as arising under subsection (4) or (5)is chargeable under Chapter 8 of Part 10 of CTA 2009 (income not otherwisecharged) (despite section 979(2) of that Act)., 
(8)The “counteraction period” means—, 
(a)if an accounting period of the payee coincides with the payment period,that accounting period, or, 
(b)otherwise, the first accounting period of the payee that is wholly orpartly within the payment period.,

(b)where the period begins after that—, 
(i)a claim has been made for the period to be a permitted period in relationto the amount of ordinary income, and, 
(ii)it is just and reasonable for the amount of ordinary income to arise forthat taxable period rather than an earlier period., 
(3)An amount of ordinary income of a payee, for a permitted taxable period, is“under taxed” if the highest rate at which tax is charged on the taxableprofits of the payee in which the amount is included, taking into account on ajust and reasonable basis the effect of any credit for underlying tax, is lessthan the payee’s full marginal rate for that period.,

###### 259EOverview of Chapter, 
(1)This Chapter contains provision that counteracts deduction/non-inclusionmismatches that it is reasonable to suppose would otherwise arise frompayments or quasi-payments because the payer is a hybrid entity.,

###### Application of Chapter, 
###### 259EACircumstances in which the Chapter applies, 
(1)This Chapter applies if conditions A to E are met., 
(2)Condition A is that a payment or quasi-payment is made under, or inconnection with, an arrangement., 
(3)Condition B is that the payer is a hybrid entity (“the hybrid payer”)., 
(4)Condition C is that—, 
(a)the hybrid payer is within the charge to corporation tax for the paymentperiod, or, 
(b)a payee is within the charge to corporation tax for an accounting periodsome or all of which falls within the payment period., 
(5)Condition D is that it is reasonable to suppose that, disregarding theprovisions mentioned in subsection (6), there would be a hybrid payerdeduction/non-inclusion mismatch in relation to the payment or quasi-payment(see section 259EB)., 
(6)The provisions are—, 
(a)this Chapter and Chapters 6 to 10, and, 
(b)any equivalent provision under the law of a territory outside the UnitedKingdom., 
(7)Condition E is that—, 
(a)it is a quasi-payment that is made as mentioned in subsection (2) and thehybrid payer is also a payee (see section 259BB(7)),, 
(b)the hybrid payer and a payee are in the same control group (see section259NB) at any time in the period—, 
(i)beginning with the day on which the arrangement mentioned in subsection (2)is made, and, 
(ii)ending with the last day of the payment period, or, 
(c)that arrangement is a structured arrangement., 
(8)The arrangement is “structured” if it is reasonable to suppose that—, 
(a)the arrangement is designed to secure a hybrid payer deduction/non-inclusion mismatch, or, 
(b)the terms of the arrangement share the economic benefit of the mismatchbetween the parties to the arrangement or otherwise reflect the fact that themismatch is expected to arise., 
(9)The arrangement may be designed to secure a hybrid payer deduction/non-inclusion mismatch despite also being designed to secure any commercial orother objective., 
(10)Sections 259EC (cases where the hybrid payer is within the charge tocorporation tax for the payment period) and 259ED (cases where a payee iswithin the charge to corporation tax) contain provision for the counteractionof the hybrid payer deduction/non-inclusion mismatch., 
###### 259EBHybrid payer deduction/non-inclusion mismatches and their extent, 
(1)There is a “hybrid payer deduction/non-inclusion mismatch”, in relation toa payment or quasi-payment, if—, 
(a)the relevant deduction exceeds the sum of the amounts of ordinary incomethat, by reason of the payment or quasi-payment, arise to each payee for apermitted taxable period, and, 
(b)all or part of that excess arises by reason of the hybrid payer being ahybrid entity., 
(2)The amount of the hybrid payer deduction/non-inclusion mismatch is equal tothe excess that arises as mentioned in subsection (1)(b)., 
(3)For the purposes of subsection (1)(b)—, 
(a)it does not matter whether the excess or part arises for another reason aswell (even if it would have arisen for that other reason regardless of whetherthe hybrid payer is a hybrid entity), and, 
(b)an excess or part of an excess is to be taken to arise by reason of thehybrid payer being a hybrid entity (so far as would not otherwise be the case)if, on making such of the relevant assumptions in relation to each payee asapply in relation to that payee (see subsection (4)), it could arise by reasonof the hybrid payer being a hybrid entity., 
(4)These are the “relevant assumptions”—, 
(a)where a payee is not within the charge to a tax under the law of a payeejurisdiction because the payee benefits from an exclusion, immunity, exemptionor relief (however described) under that law, assume that the exclusion,immunity, exemption or relief does not apply;, 
(b)where an amount of income is not included in the ordinary income of a payeefor the purposes of a tax charged under the law of a payee jurisdictionbecause the payment or quasi-payment is not made in connection with a businesscarried on by the payee in that jurisdiction, assume that the payment orquasi-payment is made in connection with such a business., 
(5)A taxable period of a payee is “permitted” in relation to an amount ofordinary income that arises as a result of the payment or quasi-payment if—, 
(a)the period begins before the end of 12 months after the end of the paymentperiod, or, 
(b)where the period begins after that—, 
(i)a claim has been made for the period to be a permitted period in relationto the amount of ordinary income, and, 
(ii)it is just and reasonable for the amount of ordinary income to arise forthat taxable period rather than an earlier period., 
###### Counteraction, 
###### 259ECCounteraction where the hybrid payer is within the charge tocorporation tax for the payment period, 
(1)This section applies where the hybrid payer is within the charge tocorporation tax for the payment period., 
(2)For corporation tax purposes, the relevant deduction so far as it does notexceed the hybrid payer deduction/non-inclusion mismatch mentioned in section259EA(5) (“the restricted deduction”) may not be deducted from the hybridpayer’s income for the payment period unless it is deducted from dualinclusion income for that period., 
(3)So much of the restricted deduction (if any) as, by virtue of subsection(2), cannot be deducted from the payer’s income for the payment period—, 
(a)is carried forward to subsequent accounting periods of the payer, and, 
(b)for corporation tax purposes, may be deducted from dual inclusion incomefor any such period (and not from any other income), so far as it cannot bededucted under this paragraph for an earlier period., 
(4)In this section “dual inclusion income” of the payer for an accountingperiod means an amount that arises in connection with the arrangementmentioned in section 259EA(2) and is both—, 
(a)ordinary income of the payer for that period for corporation tax purposes,and, 
(b)ordinary income of an investor in the payer for a permitted taxable periodfor the purposes of any tax charged under the law of an investor jurisdiction., 
(5)A taxable period of an investor is “permitted” for the purposes ofparagraph (b) of subsection (4) if—, 
(a)the period begins before the end of 12 months after the end of theaccounting period mentioned in paragraph (a) of that subsection, or, 
(b)where the period begins after that—, 
(i)a claim has been made for the period to be a permitted period in relationto the amount of ordinary income, and, 
(ii)it is just and reasonable for the amount of ordinary income to arise forthat taxable period rather than an earlier period., 
###### 259EDCounteraction where a payee is within the charge to corporationtax, 
(1)This section applies in relation to a payee where—, 
(a)the payee is within the charge to corporation tax for an accounting periodsome or all of which falls within the payment period, and, 
(b)it is reasonable to suppose that—, 
(i)no provision under the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom thatis equivalent to section 259EC applies, or, 
(ii)such a provision does apply, but does not fully counteract the hybridpayer deduction/non-inclusion mismatch mentioned in section 259EA(5)., 
(2)A provision of the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom that isequivalent to section 259EC does not fully counteract that mismatch if (andonly if)—, 
(a)the amount of the relevant deduction that the provision prevents from beingdeducted from income of the hybrid payer, for the payment period, other thandual inclusion income, is less than the amount of the mismatch, and, 
(b)the hybrid payer is still able to deduct some of the relevant deductionfrom income, for the payment period, that is not dual inclusion income., 
(3)In this section “the relevant amount” is—, 
(a)in a case where subsection (1)(b)(i) applies, an amount equal to the hybridpayer deduction/non-inclusion mismatch mentioned in section 259EA(5), or, 
(b)in a case where subsection (1)(b)(ii) applies, the lesser of—, 
(i)the amount by which that mismatch exceeds the amount of the relevantdeduction that it is reasonable to suppose is prevented, by a provision of thelaw of a territory outside the United Kingdom that is equivalent to section259EC, from being deducted from income of the hybrid payer, for the paymentperiod, other than dual inclusion income, and, 
(ii)the amount of the relevant deduction that may still be deducted asmentioned in subsection (2)(b)., 
(4)If the payee is the only payee, an amount equal to—, 
(a)the relevant amount, less, 
(b)any dual inclusion income,, 
is to be treated as income arising to the payee for the counteraction period., 
(5)If there is more than one payee, an amount equal to—, 
(a)the payee’s share of the relevant amount, less, 
(b)the relevant proportion of any dual inclusion income,, 
is to be treated as income arising to the payee for the counteraction period., 
(6)The payee’s share of the relevant amount is to be determined byapportioning that amount between all the payees on a just and reasonablebasis, having regard (in particular)—, 
(a)to any arrangements as to profit sharing that may exist between some or allof the payees, and, 
(b)to whom any amounts of ordinary income that it would be reasonable toexpect to arise as a result of the payment or quasi-payment, but that do notarise, would have arisen., 
(7)The “relevant” proportion of any dual inclusion income for the paymentperiod is the same as the proportion of the relevant amount apportioned to thepayee in accordance with subsection (6)., 
(8)An amount of income that is treated as arising under subsection (4) or (5)is chargeable under Chapter 8 of Part 10 of CTA 2009 (income not otherwisecharged) (despite section 979(2) of that Act)., 
(9)In this section—, 
  * “counteraction period” means—, 
(a), 
if an accounting period of the payee coincides with the payment period, thataccounting period, or, 
(b), 
otherwise, the first accounting period of the payee that is wholly or partlywithin the payment period;, 
  * “dual inclusion income” means an amount that arises in connection with the arrangement mentioned in section 259EA(2) and is both—, 
(a), 
ordinary income of the payer for the payment period, and, 
(b), 
ordinary income of an investor in the payer for a permitted taxable period forthe purposes of a tax charged under the law of an investor jurisdiction., 
(10)A taxable period of an investor is “permitted” for the purposes ofsubsection (9) if—, 
(a)the period begins before the end of 12 months after the end of the paymentperiod, or, 
(b)where the period begins after that—, 
(i)a claim has been made for the period to be a permitted period in relationto the amount of ordinary income, and, 
(ii)it is just and reasonable for the amount of ordinary income to arise forthat taxable period rather than an earlier period.,

(b)all or part of that excess arises by reason of one or more payees beinghybrid entities., 
(2)The extent of the hybrid payee deduction/non-inclusion mismatch is equal tothe excess that arises as mentioned in subsection (1)(b).,

(ii)a provision of the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom that isequivalent to section 259GC applies, but does not fully counteract the hybridpayee deduction/non-inclusion mismatch mentioned in section 259GA(5)., 
(2)A provision of the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom that isequivalent to section 259GC does not fully counteract that mismatch if (andonly if)—,

(b)the payer is still able to deduct some of the relevant deduction fromincome in calculating taxable profits., 
(3)In this section “the relevant amount” is—, 
(a)in a case where subsection (1)(b)(i) applies, an amount equal to the hybridpayee deduction/non-inclusion mismatch, or, 
(b)in a case where subsection (1)(b)(ii) applies, the lesser of—, 
(i)the amount by which that mismatch exceeds the amount by which it isreasonable to suppose the relevant deduction is reduced by a provision of thelaw of a territory outside the United Kingdom that is equivalent to section259GC, and, 
(ii)the amount of the relevant deduction that may still be deducted asmentioned in subsection (2)(b)., 
(4)If the investor is the only investor in the hybrid payee, the appropriateproportion of the relevant amount is to be treated as income arising to theinvestor for the counteraction period.,

(6)For the purposes of subsections (4) and (5) the “appropriate proportion ofthe relevant amount”—, 
(a)if the hybrid payee is the only hybrid payee, is all of the relevantamount, or,

(2)The mismatch is not fully counteracted if (and only if), after theapplication of such of those provisions as apply—, 
(a)the relevant deduction is not reduced by the full amount of the mismatch,, 
(b)the payer is still able to deduct some of the relevant deduction fromincome in calculating taxable profits, and, 
(c)the lesser of—, 
(i)the difference between the amount of the mismatch and the amount by whichit is reasonable to suppose the relevant deduction is reduced, and, 
(ii)the amount of the relevant deduction that may still be deducted,, 
exceeds the sum of any amounts of income treated as arising under section259GD or any equivalent provision under the law of a territory outside theUnited Kingdom., 
(3)In this section “the relevant amount” is—, 
(a)in a case where subsection (1)(a) applies, an amount equal to the hybridpayee deduction/non-inclusion mismatch mentioned in section 259GA(5), or,

(a)any arrangements as to profit sharing that may exist between some or all ofthe payees, and, 
(b)the extent to which it is reasonable to suppose that the hybrid payeededuction/non-inclusion mismatch mentioned in section 259GA(5) arises byreason of each hybrid payee being a hybrid entity., 
(7)An amount of income that is treated as arising under subsection (4) or (5)is chargeable to corporation tax on the hybrid payee (as opposed to beingchargeable to tax on any of its members) under Chapter 8 of Part 10 of CTA2009 (income not otherwise charged) (despite section 979(2) of that Act)., 
(8)Section 863 of ITTOIA 2005 (treatment of certain limited liabilitypartnerships for income tax purposes) and section 1273 of CTA 2009 (treatmentof certain limited liability partnerships for corporation tax purposes) aredisapplied in relation to the hybrid payee to the extent necessary for thepurposes of subsection (7).,

###### Counteraction, 
###### 259KCDenial of the relevant deduction in relation to the importedmismatch payment, 
(1)If, in addition to the imported mismatch payment, there are, or will be,one or more relevant payments in relation to the relevant mismatch, subsection(3) applies., 
(2)Otherwise, for corporation tax purposes, in relation to the importedmismatch payment, the relevant deduction that may be deducted from P’s incomefor the payment period is to be reduced by the amount of the relevantmismatch., 
(3)For corporation tax purposes, where this subsection applies, in relation tothe imported mismatch payment, the relevant deduction that may be deductedfrom P’s income for the payment period is to be reduced by P’s share of therelevant mismatch., 
(4)P’s share of the relevant mismatch is to be determined by apportioning therelevant mismatch between P and every payer in relation to a relevant paymenton a just and reasonable basis—, 
(a)where subsection (6)(a) applies, having regard (in particular) to theextent to which the imported mismatch payment and each relevant payment funds(directly or indirectly) the mismatch payment, or, 
(b)where the relevant mismatch is an excessive PE deduction, having regard (inparticular) to—, 
(i)if the transfer of money or money’s worth mentioned in section 259KB(3)(b)is actually made, the extent to which the imported mismatch payment and eachrelevant payment funds (directly or indirectly) the transfer, or, 
(ii)if the transfer of money or money’s worth mentioned in section 259KB(3)(b)is (in substance) treated as being made, the extent to which the importedmismatch payment and each relevant payment would have funded (directly orindirectly) the transfer if it had actually been made., 
(5)For the purposes of subsection (4)(a) and (b)(i), the imported mismatchpayment is to be taken to fund the mismatch payment or transfer to the extentthat the mismatch payment or transfer cannot be shown instead to be funded(directly or indirectly) by one or more relevant payments., 
(6)For the purposes of subsection (4)(b)(ii), it is to be assumed that theimported mismatch payment would have funded the transfer if it had actuallybeen made to the extent that it cannot be shown by P that, if it had beenmade, the transfer would have instead been funded (directly or indirectly) byone or more relevant payments., 
(7)For the purposes of this section, a payment or quasi-payment, other thanthe imported mismatch payment or any mismatch payment, is a “relevant payment”in relation to the relevant mismatch if it is made under an arrangement in theseries of arrangements mentioned in section 259KA(4) and—, 
(a)where subsection (6)(a) applies, it funds (directly or indirectly) themismatch payment,, 
(b)where the relevant mismatch is an excessive PE deduction and the transferof money or money’s worth mentioned in section 259KB(3)(b) is actually made,it funds (directly or indirectly) that transfer, or, 
(c)where the relevant mismatch is an excessive PE deduction and the transferof money or money’s worth mentioned in section 259KB(3)(b) is (in substance)treated as being made, it would have funded (directly or indirectly) thattransfer had that transfer actually been made., 
(8)In proceedings before a court or tribunal in connection with this section—, 
(a)in relation to subsection (1), it is for P to show that, in addition to theimported mismatch payment, there are one or more relevant payments in relationto the relevant mismatch, and,

(3)But the power to make adjustments by virtue of this section is subject toany time limit imposed by or under any enactment other than this Part., 
(4)No adjustment is to be made under this section on the basis that an amountof ordinary income arises, as a result of a payment or quasi-payment, to apayee after that payee’s last permitted taxable period in relation to thepayment or quasi-payment (see section 259LA, which makes provision aboutcertain such cases).,

(d)an amount of ordinary income (“the late income”) arises—, 
(i)by reason of the payment or quasi-payment, but, 
(ii)not as a consequence of any provision of this Part or any equivalentprovision of the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom,, 
to a payee for a taxable period (“the late period”) that is not a permittedtaxable period., 
(2)An amount equal to the late income may be deducted at step 2 in section4(2) of CTA 2010 in calculating the payer’s taxable total profits of theaccounting period in which the late period ends., 
(3)So much of that amount (if any) as cannot be deducted, in accordance withsubsection (2), at step 2 in section 4(2) of CTA 2010 in calculating thetaxable total profits of the accounting period in which the late period ends—, 
(a)is carried forward to subsequent accounting periods of the payer, and, 
(b)may be so deducted for any such period, so far as it cannot be deductedunder this paragraph for an earlier period., 
(4)But the total amount deducted from taxable total profits under thissection, in relation to a payment or quasi-payment, may not exceed the totalamount by which the relevant deduction is reduced as mentioned in (1)(a).,

(c)if the person’s allowance on death includes an amount of brought-forwardallowance which is greater than the amount of brought-forward allowance givenby paragraph (b), the difference between those two amounts., 
(4)For the purposes of calculating any brought-forward allowance that theperson (“P”) would have had as mentioned in subsection (3)(b)—, 
(a)section 8G (brought-forward allowance) applies, but as if references to theresidential enhancement at P’s death were references to the residentialenhancement at the time of completion of the disposal of the qualifying formerresidential interest, and, 
(b)assume that a claim for brought-forward allowance was made in relation toan amount available for carry-forward from a related person’s death if, on P’sdeath, a claim was in fact made in relation to the amount., 
(5)For the purposes of subsection (3)(c), where the person’s allowance ondeath is equal to the person’s adjusted allowance, the amount of brought-forward allowance included in the person’s allowance on death is calculated asfollows., 
  * _Step 1_, 
Express the person’s brought-forward allowance as a percentage of the person’sdefault allowance., 
  * _Step 2_, 
Multiply—, 
[![](/ukpga/2016/24/images/ukpga_20160024_en_042)](/ukpga/2016/24/images/ukpga_20160024_en_042?view=plain), 
by the percentage given by step 1., 
  * _Step 3_, 
Reduce the person’s brought-forward allowance by the amount given by step 2., 
The result is the amount of brought-forward allowance included in the person’sallowance on death., 
(6)If completion of the disposal of the qualifying former residential interestoccurs before 6 April 2017—, 
(a)for the purposes of subsection (3)(a), the residential enhancement at thetime of completion of the disposal is treated as being £100,000, and, 
(b)for the purposes of subsection (3)(b), the amount of brought-forwardallowance that the person would have had at that time is treated as being nil., 
(7)In this section, the person’s “allowance on death” means—, 
(a)where E is less than or equal to TT, the person’s default allowance, or, 
(b)where E is greater than TT, the person’s adjusted allowance., 
(8)For the purposes of this section, “completion” of the disposal of aresidential property interest occurs at the time of the disposal or, if thedisposal is under a contract which is completed by a conveyance, at the timewhen the interest is conveyed., 
(9)Where, as a result of section 8FA, there is entitlement to a downsizingaddition in calculating the person’s residence nil-rate amount, take thefollowing steps to calculate the person’s lost relievable amount., 
  * _Step 1_, 
Express the value of the person’s qualifying former residential interest as apercentage of the person’s former allowance, but take that percentage to be100% if it would otherwise be higher., 
  * _Step 2_, 
Express QRI as a percentage of the person’s allowance on death, where QRI isso much of VT as is attributable to the person’s qualifying residentialinterest, but take that percentage to be 100% if it would otherwise be higher., 
  * _Step 3_, 
Subtract the percentage given by step 2 from the percentage given by step 1,but take the result to be 0% if it would otherwise be negative., 
The result is P%., 
  * _Step 4_, 
The person’s lost relievable amount is equal to P% of the person’s allowanceon death., 
(10)Where, as a result of section 8FB, there is entitlement to a downsizingaddition in calculating the person’s residence nil-rate amount, take thefollowing steps to calculate the person’s lost relievable amount., 
  * _Step 1_, 
Express the value of the person’s qualifying former residential interest as apercentage of the person’s former allowance, but take that percentage to be100% if it would otherwise be higher., 
  * _Step 2_, 
Calculate that percentage of the person’s allowance on death.,
