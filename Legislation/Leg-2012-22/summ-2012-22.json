    "summary": "The Police (Complaints and Conduct) Act 2012 changes the way police officers are interviewed when they are being investigated for misconduct or breaching standards of professionalism. Before this law was passed, only retired officers could be questioned about their time on the force. Now, serving officers can also be interviewed if there's a complaint against them or if they're suspected of doing something wrong. These interviews will follow specific rules set by the government, like who can be present during the interview and what rights the officer has. The law applies to all current and former officers, but some exceptions might be made depending on the situation. This means that more officers can be held accountable for any mistakes they may have made while working for the police.",
