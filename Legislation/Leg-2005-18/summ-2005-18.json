It makes sure that schools are checked regularly to see how well they are doing, and that teachers and other staff are trained to help them do their jobs better. The law also says that children should have access to things like daycare and career counseling to help them succeed in life. Additionally, it ensures that personal information about students is kept private and secure, and that kids go to school or receive alternative educational support if needed.",
