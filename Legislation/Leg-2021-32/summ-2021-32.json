    "summary": "The new law helps people who get certain benefits like the state pension. These benefits will now go up based on how much things cost, not how much people earn. This means that if prices go up a lot, benefits will also go up a lot. The law only applies to England, Wales, and Scotland. It starts working right after it becomes a law. So, next time you go to the store, you might see an increase in prices, but your state pension will also go up!",
