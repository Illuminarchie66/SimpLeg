England\u2014\n\t\t\ta non-metropolitan county council is the fire and rescue authority for thecounty;\n\t\t\ta non-metropolitan district council for an area for which there is nocounty council is the fire and rescue authority for the area;\n\t\t\tthe London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority is the fire and rescueauthority for Greater London;\n\t\t\ta metropolitan county fire and civil defence authority is the fire andrescue authority for the county;\n\t\t\tthe Council of the Isles of Scilly is the fire and rescue authority for theIsles of Scilly.\n\t\tIn Wales\u2014\n\t\t\ta county council is the fire and rescue authority for the county;\n\t\t\ta county borough council is the fire and rescue authority for the countyborough.\n\t\tThis section is subject to sections 2 and 4 (schemes constituting combinedfire and rescue authorities for particular areas).\n\tPower to create combined fire and rescue authorities\n\t\tThe Secretary of State may by order make a scheme constituting a fire andrescue authority for the combined area of two or more existing fire and rescueauthorities.\n\t\tA scheme under this section may be made only if it appears to the Secretaryof State that, in the interests of\u2014\n\t\t\teconomy, efficiency and effectiveness, or\n\t\t\tpublic safety,\n\t\t\t\tthere should be a single fire and rescue authority for the combined area.\n\t\tA scheme under this section may be made by the Secretary of State\u2014\n\t\t\tto give effect to a draft scheme submitted to him by the existingauthorities in question, or\n\t\t\ton his own initiative.\n\t\tA scheme under this section made as mentioned in subsection (3)(a) mayinclude any modifications to the draft scheme which seem appropriate to theSecretary of State after consulting the existing authorities in question.\n\t\tBefore making a scheme under this section as mentioned in subsection (3)(b)the Secretary of State must consult\u2014\n\t\t\tthe existing authorities in question,\n\t\t\tany local authority all or part of whose area forms part of the combinedarea, and\n\t\t\tany other persons he considers appropriate.\n\t\tThe Secretary of State may by order vary or revoke a scheme under thissection but before doing so must consult\u2014\n\t\t\tany fire and rescue authority which appears to him likely to be affected,\n\t\t\tany other authority which would, apart from the scheme, be a fire andrescue authority under section 1 and which appears to him likely to beaffected,\n\t\t\tany local authority all or part of whose area forms part of the combinedarea or would, under the scheme as varied, form part of the combined area, and\n\t\t\tany other persons he considers appropriate.\n\t\tAn order under subsection (6) varying or revoking a scheme may includeprovision for the transfer of staff, property, rights and liabilities from thecombined fire and rescue authority to any other fire and rescue authority.\n\t\tThe Secretary of State must cause an inquiry to be held\u2014\n\t\t\tbefore making a scheme as mentioned in subsection (3)(b), or\n\t\t\tbefore varying or revoking a scheme under this section.\n\t\tThe Secretary of State is not required to cause an inquiry to be held undersubsection (8) (but may do so) if\u2014\n\t\t\tin a case within subsection (8)(a), the existing authorities in questionagree to the making of the scheme,\n\t\t\tin a case within subsection (8)(b), the combined fire and rescue authorityand any other authority which would, apart from the scheme, be a fire andrescue authority under section 1 and which would be affected by the variationor revocation, agree to the variation or revocation,\n\t\t\tin either case, it appears to the Secretary of State that the scheme,variation or revocation is to be made solely for the purpose of giving effectto an order under Part 4 of the Local Government Act [1972 (c.70)](/id/ukpga/1972/70?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\"), Part 2 of theLocal Government Act [1992 (c.

or\n\t\t\tin either case, the Secretary of State considers that, in the interests ofpublic safety, the scheme should be made, varied or revoked without delay.\n\t\tSubsection (11) applies if\u2014\n\t\t\tan order is made under Part 4 of the Local Government Act [1972 (c.70)](/id/ukpga/1972/70?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\"), Part 2 of theLocal Government Act [1992 (c.

inrelation to any area, but\n\t\t\tthe order, or any provision of the order, has not come into force.\n\t\tIf this subsection applies\u2014\n\t\t\ta scheme under this section may be made as if the order or provisionreferred to in subsection (10)(b) were in force, and\n\t\t\tthis section has effect in relation to any scheme so made, or proposed tobe so made, as if the order or provision were in force;\n\t\t\tbut a scheme so made may not come into force before the order or provisiondoes.\n\tCreation of combined fire and rescue authorities: supplementary\n\t\tA combined fire and rescue authority constituted under a scheme undersection 2 must be constituted as a body corporate.\n\t\tA scheme under section 2 may, subject to this section, make anysupplementary and incidental provision which the Secretary of State considersappropriate.\n\t\tIn particular, a scheme under section 2 may make provision about\u2014\n\t\t\tthe composition of the combined authority (including provision for theappointment of members by the existing authorities or by the Secretary ofState);\n\t\t\tthe proceedings of the combined authority (including different provision inrespect of the voting rights of different categories of member);\n\t\t\tthe financing of the combined authority (including provision for thepayment of expenses out of a combined fire and rescue service fund maintainedby the existing authorities);\n\t\t\tthe discharge of the functions of the combined authority (includingprovision for the discharge of functions by committees);\n\t\t\tofficers of the combined authority;\n\t\t\tthe acquisition, appropriation and disposal of land by the combinedauthority (including provision for the acquisition of land by agreement orcompulsorily);\n\t\t\tthe transfer of staff, property, rights and liabilities to or from thecombined authority;\n\t\t\tthe payment of compensation in respect of loss suffered by any person inconsequence of the constitution of the combined authority.\n\t\tA scheme under section 2 may not make provision for the appointment by theSecretary of State of a number of members equal to, or exceeding, half thetotal number of members capable of being appointed.\n\t\tIf a scheme under section 2 provides for members of a combined authority tobe appointed by the Secretary of State, it must also provide that any decisionof the authority to\u2014\n\t\t\tissue a precept under section 40 of the Local Government Finance Act [1992(c. 14)](/id/ukpga/1992/14?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\"), or\n\t\t\tmake the calculations required by section 43 of that Act,\n\t\t\t\tmust be approved by more than half of the members of the authority notappointed by the Secretary of State.\n\tCombined authorities under the Fire Services Act 1947\n\t\tThis section applies to a scheme approved under section 5 of the FireServices Act [1947 (c. 41)](/id/ukpga/1947/41?view=plain \"Go to item oflegislation\") (voluntary schemes for combining fire authorities), or madeunder section 6 of that Act (combination schemes made by the Secretary ofState), which is in force immediately before the repeal of those sections bythis Act.\n\t\tA scheme to which this section applies continues to have effect despitethat repeal.\n\t\tThe combined authority constituted by a scheme to which this sectionapplies is the fire and rescue authority for the area for which it isconstituted.\n\t\tThe Secretary of State may by order vary or revoke a scheme to which thissection applies.\n\t\tBefore making an order under subsection (4) in relation to a scheme theSecretary of State must consult\u2014\n\t\t\tany fire and rescue authority which appears to him likely to be affected,\n\t\t\tany other authority which would, apart from the scheme, be a fire andrescue authority under section 1 and which appears to him likely to beaffected,\n\t\t\tany local authority all or part of whose area forms part of the combinedarea or would, under the scheme as varied, form part of the combined area, and\n\t\t\tany other persons he considers appropriate.\n\t\tBefore making an order under subsection (4) varying or revoking a schemethe Secretary of State must cause an inquiry to be held.\n\t\tThe Secretary of State is not required to cause an inquiry to be held undersubsection (6) (but may do so) if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe combined authority and any other authority which would, apart from thescheme, be a fire and rescue authority under section 1 and which would beaffected by the variation or revocation, agree to the variation or revocation,\n\t\t\tit appears to the Secretary of State that the scheme is to be varied orrevoked solely for the purpose of giving effect to an order made under Part 4of the Local Government Act [1972 (c. 70)](/id/ukpga/1972/70?view=plain \"Go toitem of legislation\"), Part 2 of the Local Government Act [1992 (c.19)](/id/ukpga/1992/19?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\") or section 17of the Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act [2003 (c.10)](/id/ukpga/2003/10?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\"), or\n\t\t\tthe Secretary of State considers that, in the interests of public safety,the scheme should be varied or revoked without delay.\n\tPowers of combined fire and rescue authorities\n\t\tA fire and rescue authority constituted by a scheme under section 2 or ascheme to which section 4 applies has power to do anything which is calculatedto facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of itsfunctions.\n\t\tSubsection (1) is subject to the provisions of this
