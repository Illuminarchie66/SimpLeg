    "summary": "\nThe Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act of 2009 is a law that helps people get trained and educated in England and Wales. It talks about things like apprenticeships, schools, and kids who are in trouble with the law. Here are some important parts of the law:\n* If you want to do an apprenticeship, there are rules you need to follow. You need to sign an agreement and meet certain requirements.\n* The law says that kids who are in youth detention centers should get an education. Local education authorities have to make sure this happens.\n* There is something called the Young People's Learning Agency that helps provide education and training for young people who are in trouble with the law.\n* If you have a concern about a school in England, you can talk to the Local Commissioner. They will listen to your concerns and might even investigate.\nThis law is important because it helps make sure that people have access to education and training, and that schools are held accountable for how they treat their students."
