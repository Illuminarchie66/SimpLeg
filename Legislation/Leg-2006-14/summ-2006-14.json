    "general": "The Consumer Credit Act 2006 is a law that helps protect people who borrow money from banks or other financial institutions. It makes sure that these lenders follow certain rules and treat their customers fairly. The law also sets up an \"ombudsman\" who can help resolve disputes between customers and lenders if they cannot come to an agreement on their own. This law is important because it helps ensure that consumers are not taken advantage of by predatory lending practices, and it provides a way for them to seek redress if something goes wrong with their loan.",

    "summary": "The Consumer Credit Act 2006 improves protections for borrowers by removing financial limits and introducing new exemptions for certain types of credit agreements. This means more people can access credit without worrying about hitting financial limits. High net worth individuals, businesses, and unincorporated bodies of persons that don't consist entirely of bodies corporate may qualify for these exemptions. Additionally, the act requires creditors to provide regular statements to debtors and update them every three months to ensure relevance and usefulness. It also prohibits creditors from enforcing agreements if they fail to give debtors notices within specified time periods. If you're having trouble paying back a loan, you can now apply for time orders to extend the repayment period of your consumer credit agreements. This law helps protect you from unfair relationships with creditors and ensures they follow fair practices.\nThe Consumer Credit Act 2006 also regulates licensing and charges for those seeking to become licensed credit providers. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) can impose charges on applicants for licences or renewals, with the amount determined by the OFT through general notices. The OFT can also modify standard licenses held by lenders, remove limitations on the types of businesses they can operate, add new descriptions of business, or cover additional types of business. Furthermore, the OFT can make orders before issuing a standard license to someone who has applied for one, if they believe that the person will not operate their business in a way that benefits consumers.\nLastly, the Consumer Credit Act 2006 sets out rules for maintaining records of consumer credit agreements and the process for appealing decisions related to these agreements. The Act specifies the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) must keep a register of all consumer credit agreements and provide certain particulars, including any variations made to the agreement. The OFT must provide notice to certain individuals or entities when making determinations related to requirements under sections 33A and 33B of the Act."
