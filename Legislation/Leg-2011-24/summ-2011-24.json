    "summary": "\nThe Public Bodies Act 2011 is a law that gives the UK government and Welsh ministers the power to make changes to public bodies and their functions. This means that certain public bodies can have their powers changed or removed, and their functions can be transferred to other bodies. Additionally, the act allows for the modification of constitutional arrangements of public bodies, which can include changing the way they operate or the people who run them. However, there are restrictions on the powers of ministers and Welsh ministers to ensure that they cannot remove necessary protections or prevent individuals from exercising their rights and freedoms. Furthermore, the act includes provisions for consultation, explanation documents, and time limits for parliamentary approval to ensure that any modifications or transfers of functions are properly considered and justified. Overall, the Public Bodies Act 2011 aims to streamline the process of modifying public bodies and their functions, while ensuring that proper safeguards are in place to protect individuals and their rights."
