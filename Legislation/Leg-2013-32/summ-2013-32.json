It also requires companies to provide redress to customers if they experience problems, and allows the government to impose fees on certain costs incurred by the Secretary of State. Additionally, the act includes provisions related to smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. Overall, the purpose of the Energy Act 2013 is to promote the use of cleaner, more sustainable energy sources and improve the efficiency and safety of the energy industry.",
