    "summary": "The Supply and Appropriation (Anticipation and Adjustments) Act 2022 allows the UK government to spend up to \u00a3410 billion on various things over the next three years, starting from April 2021. This includes \u00a3351 billion for day-to-day spending and \u00a358 billion for long-term investments like roads and schools. The government can take this money from the Consolidated Fund.\n\nThis law also helps fix some mistakes in how much money was spent last year and makes sure there's enough money left over to cover any extra costs that come up. It covers both the current budget and the capital budget, so it's important for planning how the country will run over the next few years.",
