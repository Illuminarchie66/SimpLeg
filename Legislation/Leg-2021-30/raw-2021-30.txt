Schedule 7A (biodiversity gain in England) has effect.”, 
2In that Act, after Schedule 7 insert—, 
Section 90A, 
#### “SCHEDULE 7ABiodiversity gain in England, 
##### PART 1Overview and interpretation, 
###### Overview, 
1(1)This Schedule makes provision for grants of planning permission in Englandto be subject to a condition to secure that the biodiversity gain objective ismet., 
(2)Paragraphs 2 to 12 have effect for the purposes of this Schedule., 
###### Biodiversity gain objective, 
2(1)The biodiversity gain objective is met in relation to development forwhich planning permission is granted if the biodiversity value attributable tothe development exceeds the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsitehabitat by at least the relevant percentage., 
(2)The biodiversity value attributable to the development is the total of—, 
(a)the post-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat,, 
(b)the biodiversity value, in relation to the development, of any registeredoffsite biodiversity gain allocated to the development, and, 
(c)the biodiversity value of any biodiversity credits purchased for thedevelopment., 
(3)The relevant percentage is 10%., 
(4)The Secretary of State may by regulations amend this paragraph so as tochange the relevant percentage., 
###### Biodiversity value and the biodiversity metric, 
3References to the biodiversity value of any habitat or habitat enhancementare to its value as calculated in accordance with the biodiversity metric., 
4(1)The biodiversity metric is a document for measuring, for the purposes ofthis Schedule, the biodiversity value or relative biodiversity value ofhabitat or habitat enhancement., 
(2)The biodiversity metric is to be produced and published by the Secretary ofState., 
(3)The Secretary of State may from time to time revise and republish thebiodiversity metric., 
(4)Before publishing or republishing the biodiversity metric the Secretary ofState must consult such persons as the Secretary of State considersappropriate., 
(5)The Secretary of State may by regulations make transitional provision inrelation to the revision and republication of the biodiversity metric., 
(6)The Secretary of State must lay the biodiversity metric, and any revisedbiodiversity metric, before Parliament., 
###### Pre-development biodiversity value,

7Where planning permission is granted in respect of land which is registeredin the biodiversity gain site register under section 100 of the EnvironmentAct 2021, the pre-development biodiversity value of the land is the total of—,

(a)the person submitting the biodiversity gain plan for approval proposes tocarry out works in the course of the development that increase thebiodiversity value of the onsite habitat, and, 
(b)the planning authority considers that the increase is significant inrelation to the pre-development biodiversity value., 
(2)The increase in biodiversity value referred to in sub-paragraph (1) is tobe taken into account in calculating the post-development biodiversity valueof the onsite habitat only if the planning authority is satisfied that thecondition in sub-paragraph (3) is met., 
(3)The condition is that any habitat enhancement resulting from the worksreferred to in sub-paragraph (1)(a) will, by virtue of—, 
(a)a condition subject to which the planning permission is granted,,

be maintained for at least 30 years after the development is completed., 
(4)The Secretary of State may by regulations amend sub-paragraph (3) so as tosubstitute for the period for the time being specified there a differentperiod of at least 30 years., 
###### Registered offsite biodiversity gains, 
10(1)“Registered offsite biodiversity gain” means any habitat enhancement,where—,
