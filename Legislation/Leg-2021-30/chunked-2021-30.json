one matter within each priorityarea.\n\t\tThe priority areas are\u2014\n\t\t\tair quality;\n\t\t\twater; \n\t\t\tbiodiversity; \n\t\t\tresource efficiency and waste reduction.\n\t\tA target set under this section must specify\u2014\n\t\t\ta standard to be achieved, which must be capable of being objectivelymeasured, and\n\t\t\ta date by which it is to be achieved.\n\t\tRegulations under this section may make provision about how the matter inrespect of which a target is set is to be measured.\n\t\tA target is a \u201clong-term\u201d target if the specified date is no less than 15years after the date on which the target is initially set.\n\t\tA target under this section is initially set when the regulations settingit come into force.\n\t\tIn this Part the \u201cspecified standard\u201d and \u201cspecified date\u201d, in relation toa target under this section, mean the standard and date (respectively)specified under subsection (4).\n\t\tThe Secretary of State may not

matter\n\t\tThe Secretary of State must by regulations set a target (\u201cthe PM2.5 airquality target\u201d) in respect of the annual mean level of PM2.5 in ambient air.\n\t\tThe PM2.5 air quality target may, but need not, be a long-term target.\n\t\tIn this section \u201cPM2.5\u201d means particulate matter with an aerodynamicdiameter not exceeding 2.5 micrometres.\n\t\tRegulations setting the PM2.5 air quality target may make provisiondefining \u201cambient air\u201d.\n\t\tThe duty in subsection (1) is in addition to (and does not discharge) theduty in section 1(2) to set a long-term target in relation to air quality.\n\t\tSection 1(4) to (9) applies to the PM2.5 air quality target and toregulations under this section as it applies to targets set under section 1and to regulations

under sections 1 to 3 whichrevoke or lower a target (the \u201cexisting target\u201d) only if satisfied that\u2014\n\t\t\tmeeting the existing target would have no significant benefit compared withnot meeting it or with meeting a lower target, or\n\t\t\tbecause of changes in circumstances since the existing target was set orlast amended the environmental, social, economic or other costs of meeting itwould be disproportionate to the benefits.\n\t\tBefore making regulations under sections 1 to 3 which revoke or lower atarget the Secretary of State must lay before Parliament, and publish, astatement explaining why the Secretary of State is satisfied as mentioned insubsection (3).\n\t\tRegulations lower a target if, to any extent, they\u2014\n\t\t\treplace the specified standard with a lower standard, or\n\t\t\treplace the specified date with a later date.\n\t\tRegulations under section 2 may not revoke the PM2.5 air quality target(but may amend it in accordance with this section).\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Part a target is met if the specified standard isachieved by the specified date.\n\t\tRegulations under sections 1 to 3 are subject to the affirmative

appeal brought under section 12D.\n\t\t\tIn determining an appeal, the CMA must have regard, to the same extent asis required of the Authority, to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe Authority\u2019s duties under section 2, and\n\t\t\t\tthe Authority\u2019s strategic priorities and objectives as set out in astatement under section 2A.\n\t\t\tIn determining the appeal the CMA\u2014\n\t\t\t\tmay have regard to

matter to whichthe Authority would not have been entitled to have regard in reaching itsdecision had it had the opportunity of doing so.\n\t\t\tThe CMA may allow the appeal only to the extent that it is satisfied thatthe decision appealed against was wrong on one or more of the followinggrounds\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat the Authority failed properly to have regard to any matter mentionedin subsection

allowed);\n\t\t\t\tremit the matter back to the Authority for reconsideration anddetermination in accordance with any directions given by the CMA.\n\t\t\tA direction under subsection (1) must not require the Authority to doanything that it would not have power to do (apart from the direction).\n\t\t\tThe Authority must comply with a direction given to it under thatsubsection.\n\t\tHTime limits

where\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe CMA has received representations on the timing of the determinationfrom a party to the appeal, and\n\t\t\t\tit is satisfied that there are special reasons why the determination cannotbe made within the period specified in subsection (1).\n\t\t\tWhere subsection (2) applies, the CMA must determine an appeal within theperiod specified by it, not being longer than the period of 5 months beginningwith the permission date.\n\t\t\tWhere subsection (2) applies, the CMA must also\u2014\n\t\t\t\tinform the parties to the appeal of the time limit for determining theappeal, and\n\t\t\t\tpublish that time limit in a way it considers appropriate to bring it tothe attention of any other persons likely to be affected by the determination.\n\t\t\tReferences in this section to the permission date are to the date on whichthe CMA gave permission to bring the appeal in accordance with section 12D(3).\n\t\t\tIn this section and in section 12I any reference to a party

made;\n\t\t\t\tin a way the CMA considers appropriate to bring it to the attention of anyperson likely to be affected by it (other than a party to the appeal).\n\t\t\tThe CMA may exclude from publication any information it is satisfied is\u2014\n\t\t\t\tcommercial information, the disclosure of which would, or in the CMA\u2019sopinion might, significantly harm the legitimate business interests of anundertaking to which it relates, or\n\t\t\t\tinformation relating to the private affairs of an individual, thedisclosure of which would, or in the CMA\u2019s opinion might,
