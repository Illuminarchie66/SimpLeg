    "summary": "The Modern Slavery Act of 2015 protects people from being held against their will or forced to work without their consent. It also punishes those who traffic humans for exploitation. This law covers all British citizens and non-citizens who engage in these activities within the UK or abroad. Consent is not a defense for these crimes, and the law allows for severe penalties for those found guilty of violating it. Additionally, the law gives authorities the power to stop and search ships suspected of human trafficking in international waters. The Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner helps ensure that the law is followed correctly. If you or someone you know has been a victim of modern slavery, please contact the authorities immediately."
