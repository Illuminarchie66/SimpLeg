    "general": "This law makes sure that if an animal needs help because someone has treated them badly, then the people who are supposed to take care of the animal can make decisions about how to keep the animal safe. This could include finding a new home for the animal, making sure they get medical care, or even putting the animal down if they are too hurt or sick to recover. The goal of the law is to protect animals from mistreatment and make sure they receive proper care.",
