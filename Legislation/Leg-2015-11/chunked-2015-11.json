inparticular\u2014\n\t\t\t\trestrictions as to the total quantity of the tobacco products, or of thetobacco products of a particular description, that may, during the controlledperiod, be removed for home use, and\n\t\t\t\trestrictions as to the quantity of the tobacco products, or the tobaccoproducts of a particular description, that may be removed for home use duringany month, or any period of two weeks, in the controlled period.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is subject to subsections (4) and (5).\n\t\t\tAn anti-forestalling notice may not restrict a person, during thecontrolled period, to removing for home use a total quantity of the tobaccoproducts, or of the tobacco products of a particular description, that is lessthan 80% of\u2014\n\t\t\t[![](/ukpga/2015/11/images/ukpga_20150011_en_006)](/ukpga/2015/11/images/ukpga_20150011_en_006?view=plain)\n\t\t\twhere\u2014\n\t\t\t\t  * TPY is the total quantity of the tobacco

penalty of\u2014\n\t\t\t\tif the person has given an admission notice, 150% of the lost duty, and\n\t\t\t\totherwise, 200% of the lost duty.\n\t\t\tAn \u201cadmission notice\u201d is a notice\u2014\n\t\t\t\tin which the person admits that the person\u2014\n\t\t\t\thas failed to comply with the anti-forestalling notice, and\n\t\t\t\tis liable to a penalty determined in accordance with subsection (3), and\n\t\t\t\tthat is in such form, and that provides such information, as theCommissioners may specify.\n\t\t\tAn admission notice cannot be given if, at any time in the period of 3years ending with the day before the controlled period, the person has givenan admission notice in relation to a failure to comply with another anti-forestalling notice.\n\t\t\tAn admission notice cannot be given\u2014\n\t\t\t\tat a time when the person has reason to believe that Her Majesty\u2019s Revenueand Customs have discovered, or are about to discover, that the person hasfailed to comply with the anti-forestalling notice, or\n\t\t\t\tafter the end of the controlled period.\n\t\t\tThe \u201clost duty\u201d is the amount (if any) by which the duty that would havebeen charged under section 2 on the excess tobacco products if they had,immediately after the end of the controlled period, been removed for home useexceeds the duty that was charged under that section on those tobaccoproducts.\n\t\t\tThe \u201cexcess tobacco products\u201d are the tobacco products mentioned insubsection (1) that the person removed, for home use, in contravention of ananti-forestalling restriction.\n\t\t\tSee section 6A for the meaning of \u201canti-forestalling notice\u201d, \u201canti-forestalling restriction\u201d and \u201ccontrolled period\u201d.\u201d"
