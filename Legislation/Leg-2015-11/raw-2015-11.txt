##### PART 3Main computation rules, 
###### Disposals to which this Part applies, 
4(1)This Part of this Schedule applies where a person (“P”) makes a non-resident CGT disposal of (or of a part of) an interest in UK land., 
(2)But this Part of this Schedule does not apply if the disposal is—, 
(a)a relevant high value disposal, or, 
(b)a disposal in which a relevant high value disposal is comprised (seeparagraph 12(3))., 
(3)In this Part of this Schedule “the disposed of interest” means—, 
(a)the interest in UK land, or, 
(b)if the disposal is of part of that interest, the part disposed of., 
###### Introduction to paragraphs 6 to 8, 
5(1)Paragraphs 6 to 8 apply where—, 
(a)the disposed of interest was held by P on 5 April 2015, and, 
(b)P has not made an election under paragraph 2(1)(b) in relation to theinterest in UK land., 
(2)In paragraphs 6 and 7—, 
(a)“notional post-April 2015 gain or loss” means the gain or loss which wouldhave accrued on the disposal had P acquired the disposed of interest on 5April 2015 for a consideration equal to its market value on that date;, 
(b)“notional pre-April 2015 gain or loss” means the gain or loss which wouldhave accrued on 5 April 2015 had the disposed of interest been disposed of fora consideration equal to its market value on that date;, 
but see also paragraph 8(1)., 
(3)For the purpose of determining the amount of the hypothetical gain or lossmentioned in sub-paragraph (2)(a), no account is taken of section 57B or thisSchedule (apart from paragraph 23)., 
###### Assets held at 5 April 2015: default method, 
6(1)The NRCGT gain or loss accruing on the disposal is equal to the relevantfraction of the notional post-April 2015 gain or loss (as the case may be)., 
But see also sub-paragraph (3)., 
(2)“The relevant fraction” is—, 
[![](/ukpga/2015/11/images/ukpga_20150011_en_010)](/ukpga/2015/11/images/ukpga_20150011_en_010?view=plain), 
where—, 
  * “RD” is the number of days in the post-commencement ownership period on which the subject matter of the disposed of interest consists wholly or partly of a dwelling;, 
  * “TD” is the total number of days in the post-commencement ownership period., 
(3)If there has been mixed use of the subject matter of the disposed ofinterest on one or more days in the post-commencement ownership period, theNRCGT gain or loss accruing on the disposal is the fraction of the amount thatwould (apart from this sub-paragraph) be given by sub-paragraphs (1) and (2)that is, on a just and reasonable apportionment, attributable to the dwellingor dwellings., 
(4)For the purposes of this paragraph there is “mixed use” of land on any dayon which the land consists partly, but not exclusively, of one or moredwellings., 
(5)“Post-commencement ownership period” means the period beginning with 6April 2015 and ending with the day before the day on which the disposaloccurs., 
7The gain or loss accruing on the disposal which is not an NRCGT gain or (asthe case may be) loss is computed as follows., 
  *  _Step 1_, 
Determine the amount of the notional pre-April 2015 gain or loss., 
  * _Step 2_, 
In a case where there is a notional post-April 2015 gain, determine the amountof that gain remaining after the deduction of the NRCGT gain determined underparagraph 6., 
  * _Step 3_, 
In a case where there is a notional post-April 2015 loss, determine the amountof that loss remaining after the deduction of the NRCGT loss determined underparagraph 6., 
  * _Step 4_, 
Add—, 
(a), 
the amount of any gain or loss determined under Step 1, and, 
(b), 
the amount of any gain determined under Step 2 or (as the case may be) anyloss determined under Step 3,, 
(treating any amount which is a loss as a negative amount)., 
If the result is a positive amount, that amount is the gain on the disposalwhich is not an NRCGT gain., 
If the result is a negative amount, that amount (expressed as a positivenumber) is the loss on the disposal which is not an NRCGT loss., 
###### Modified application of paragraphs 5 to 7 where election made forstraight-line time apportionment, 
8(1)Where the non-resident CGT disposal is of (or of a part of) an interest inUK land in respect of which P makes, or has made, an election for straight-line time apportionment under paragraph 2(1)(a)—, 
(a)paragraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 5(2) do not apply in relation to thedisposal, and, 
(b)for the purposes of paragraphs 6 and 7, the “notional pre-April 2015 gainor loss” and the “notional post-April 2015 gain or loss” are to be determinedin accordance with the following steps., 
  * _Step 1_, 
Determine the amount of the gain or loss which accrues to P on the disposal., 
For the purpose of determining that amount, no account is taken of section 57Bor this Schedule (apart from paragraph 23)., 
  * _Step 2_, 
An amount equal to the post-commencement fraction of that gain or loss is thenotional post-April 2015 gain or (as the case may be) loss., 
  * _Step 3_, 
An amount equal to the pre-commencement fraction of that gain or loss is thenotional pre-April 2015 gain or (as the case may be) loss.,

###### Cases where asset acquired after 5 April 2015 or election made underparagraph 2(1)(b), 
9(1)This paragraph applies if—, 
(a)the disposed of interest was not held by P throughout the period beginningwith 5 April 2015 and ending with the disposal, or, 
(b)the non-resident CGT disposal is of (or of part of) an interest in UK landin respect of which P makes, or has made, an election under paragraph 2(1)(b)., 
(2)The NRCGT gain or loss accruing on the disposal is computed as follows., 
  * _Step 1_, 
Determine the amount of the gain or loss which accrues to P., 
For the purpose of determining the amount of that gain or loss, no account istaken of section 57B or this Schedule (apart from paragraph 23)., 
  * _Step 2_, 
The NRCGT gain or (as the case may be) loss accruing on the disposal is anamount equal to the relevant fraction of that gain or loss (but see Step 3)., 
  * _Step 3_, 
If there has been mixed use of the subject matter of the disposed of intereston one or more days in the relevant ownership period, the NRCGT gain or lossaccruing on the disposal is equal to the appropriate fraction of the amountgiven by Step 2.,

In a case where there is a gain under Step 1 of sub-paragraph (2), determinethe amount of that gain remaining after the deduction of the NRCGT gaindetermined under that sub-paragraph., 
That remaining gain is the gain accruing on the disposal which is not an NRCGTgain., 
  * _Step 2_, 
In a case where there is a loss under Step 1 of sub-paragraph (2), determinethe amount of that loss remaining after deduction of the NRCGT loss determinedunder that sub-paragraph., 
That remaining loss is the loss accruing on the disposal which is not an NRCGTloss.,

(a)for the NRCGT gains or losses to be computed for each relevant high valuedisposal comprised in the non-resident CGT disposal (paragraphs 13 to 15), and, 
(b)for the results to be added (where necessary) to find the NRCGT gain orloss on the non-resident CGT disposal (see paragraph 12)., 
(3)For provision about how to compute any ATED-related gains or lossesaccruing on the relevant high value disposals, see Schedule 4ZZA., 
(4)Paragraphs 16 to 19 contain provisions for computing any gains or lossesaccruing on the disposals mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) which are neitherATED-related nor NRCGT gains or losses, including provision—, 
(a)for such balancing gains or losses to be computed for each relevant highvalue disposal comprised in the non-resident CGT disposal, and, 
(b)for the results to be added together (where necessary) to find thebalancing gain or loss on the non-resident CGT disposal (see paragraph 16).,

  * _Step 2_, 
Add together the amounts of any gains or losses determined under Step 1(treating any amount which is a loss as a negative amount)., 
If the result is a positive amount, that amount is the NRCGT gain on thedisposal of land., 
If the result is a negative amount, that amount (expressed as a positivenumber) is the NRCGT loss on the disposal of land., 
See paragraphs 16 to 19 for how to compute the gain or loss on the disposal ofland which is neither ATED-related nor an NRCGT gain or loss., 
(3)For the purposes of this Schedule, a relevant high value disposal is“comprised in” a non-resident CGT disposal if—,

  * Q is the amount given by subsection (2) or (3)., 
(2)Where the reference period is not immediately preceded by another referenceperiod but is preceded by an accounting period of the company, Q is equal tothe amount (if any) that is to be carried forward from that precedingaccounting period under section 332FC(1)., 
(3)Where the reference period is immediately preceded by another referenceperiod, Q is equal to the amount (if any) carried forward under section332HB(1)., 
###### 332HBCarry-forward of unactivated allowance from a reference period, 
(1)If, in the case of a reference period (“RP1”) of a company, the amountgiven by subsection (2) is greater than zero, that amount is treated asinvestment allowance held by the company for the qualifying oil field for thenext period (and is treated as held with effect from the beginning of thatperiod)., 
(2)The amount is—, 
U − A − T, 
where—, 
  * U is the total amount of unactivated allowance attributable to the reference period and the qualifying oil field (see section 332HA(1));, 
  * A is the amount of activated allowance that the company has for the qualifying oil field for the reference period (see section 332H(1));, 
  * T is any amount that is required by section 332IA(1) (reduction of allowance if equity disposed of) to be deducted in connection with a disposal or disposals made on the day following the end of the reference period., 
(3)If RP1 is immediately followed by another reference period of the company(belonging to the same qualifying oil field), “the next period” means thatreference period., 
(4)If subsection (3) does not apply, “the next period” means the nextaccounting period of the company.,

(2)The amount is—, 
U − A − T, 
where—, 
  * U is the closing balance of unactivated allowance held for the accounting period and the cluster area;,
