    "general": "The Sustainable Energy Act 2003 helps Britain use cleaner, more environmentally friendly ways to generate electricity. It encourages things like wind farms, solar panels, and other renewable sources of power instead of using dirty fossil fuels like coal and gas. This law also makes sure that big companies are held accountable if they don't follow these new rules. The goal is to reduce pollution and protect our planet for future generations.",

    "summary": "The Sustainable Energy Act of 2003 is a law passed in the United Kingdom to promote sustainable energy policies and reduce carbon emissions. It sets requirements for energy reporting, energy efficiency targets for residential buildings, and renewable energy promotion. The act establishes an annual report on the progress made towards reducing carbon emissions and maintaining reliable energy supplies. Additionally, it sets energy efficiency targets for residential buildings in England and Wales, and requires energy conservation authorities to take measures to improve energy efficiency. Finally, the act requires the government to set combined heat and power targets and conduct impact assessments before implementing new proposals. Overall, the goal of the Sustainable Energy Act is to promote sustainable energy practices and reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels."
