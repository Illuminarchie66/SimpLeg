    "summary": "The Energy Act 2010 is a law passed by the UK government to promote the use of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology in the energy industry. It provides financial assistance to encourage the use of CCS technology and requires the Authority to monitor the effectiveness of the schemes. Additionally, the law empowers the government to modify existing licensing agreements for electricity generation to control prices during periods of high demand. The act also gives the government the power to adjust energy charges for certain groups of consumers if they are being unfairly charged. Finally, the act includes provisions for orders and regulations to be made by statutory instruments, and requires parliamentary approval before some sections take effect."
