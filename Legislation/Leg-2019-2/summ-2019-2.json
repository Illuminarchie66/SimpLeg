    "summary": "The Voyeurism (Offences) Act 2019 makes it illegal for people to secretly watch or record others in private situations without their knowledge or consent. This includes using equipment like cameras or phones to take pictures or videos of people underneath their clothes or in places where they wouldn't usually be seen. It also makes it illegal to help someone else do these things without their knowledge. If you get caught doing any of these things, you could go to jail for up to 2 years if it's a serious case, or just over 1 year if it's not as bad. This law only applies to England and Wales, and started being enforced after 2 months from when it was made into a law.",
