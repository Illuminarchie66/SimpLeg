true.\n\t\tSubsection (3) applies in an action for defamation if the statementcomplained of conveys two or more distinct imputations.\n\t\tIf one or more of the imputations is not shown to be substantially true,the defence under this section does not fail if, having regard to theimputations which are shown to be substantially true, the imputations whichare not shown to be substantially true do not seriously harm the claimant\u2019sreputation.\n\t\tThe common law defence of justification is abolished and, accordingly,section 5 of the Defamation Act 1952 (justification) is repealed.\n\tHonest opinion\n\t\tIt is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show thatthe following conditions are met.\n\t\tThe first condition is that the statement complained of was a statement ofopinion.\n\t\tThe second condition is that the statement complained of indicated, whetherin general or specific terms, the basis of the opinion.\n\t\tThe third condition is that an honest person could have held the opinion onthe basis of\u2014\n\t\t\tany fact which existed at the time the statement complained of waspublished;\n\t\t\tanything asserted to be a fact in a privileged statement published beforethe statement complained of.\n\t\tThe defence is defeated if the claimant shows that the defendant did nothold the opinion.\n\t\tSubsection (5) does not apply in a case where the statement complained ofwas published by the defendant but made by another person (\u201cthe author\u201d); andin such a case the defence is defeated if the claimant shows that thedefendant knew or ought to have known that the author did not hold theopinion.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (4)(b) a statement is a \u201cprivilegedstatement\u201d if the person responsible for its publication would have one ormore of the following defences if an action for defamation were brought inrespect of it\u2014\n\t\t\ta defence under section 4 (publication on matter of public interest);\n\t\t\ta defence under section 6 (peer-reviewed statement in scientific oracademic journal);\n\t\t\ta defence under section 14 of the Defamation Act 1996 (reports of courtproceedings protected by absolute privilege);\n\t\t\ta defence under section 15 of that Act (other reports protected byqualified privilege).\n\t\tThe common law defence of fair comment is abolished and, accordingly,section 6 of the Defamation Act 1952 (fair comment) is repealed.\n\tPublication on matter of public interest\n\t\tIt is a defence to an action for defamation for the defendant to show that\u2014\n\t\t\tthe statement complained of was, or formed part of, a statement on a matterof public interest; and\n\t\t\tthe defendant reasonably believed that publishing the statement complainedof was in the public interest.\n\t\tSubject to subsections (3) and (4), in determining whether the defendanthas shown the matters mentioned in subsection (1), the court must have regardto all the circumstances of the case.\n\t\tIf the statement complained of was, or formed part of, an accurate andimpartial account of a dispute to which the claimant was a party, the courtmust in determining whether it was reasonable for the defendant to believethat publishing the statement was in the public interest disregard anyomission of the defendant to take steps to verify the truth of the imputationconveyed by it.\n\t\tIn determining whether it was reasonable for the defendant to believe thatpublishing the statement complained of was in the public interest, the courtmust make such allowance for editorial judgement as it considers appropriate.\n\t\tFor the avoidance of doubt, the defence under this section may be reliedupon irrespective of whether the statement complained of is a statement offact or a statement of opinion.\n\t\tThe common law defence known as the Reynolds defence is abolished.\n\tOperators of websites\n\t\tThis section applies where an action for defamation is brought against theoperator of a website in respect of a statement posted on the website.\n\t\tIt is a defence for the operator to show that it was not the operator whoposted the statement on the website.\n\t\tThe defence is defeated if the claimant shows that\u2014\n\t\t\tit was not possible for the claimant to identify the person who posted thestatement,\n\t\t\tthe claimant gave the operator a notice of complaint in relation to thestatement, and\n\t\t\tthe operator failed to respond to the notice of complaint in accordancewith any provision contained in regulations.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (3)(a), it is possible for a claimant to\u201cidentify\u201d a person only if the claimant has sufficient information to bringproceedings against the person.\n\t\tRegulations may\u2014\n\t\t\tmake provision as to the action required to be taken by an operator of awebsite in response to a notice of complaint (which may in particular includeaction relating to the identity or contact details of the person who postedthe statement and action relating to its removal);\n\t\t\tmake provision specifying a time limit for the taking of any such action;\n\t\t\tmake provision conferring on the court a discretion to treat action takenafter the expiry of a time limit as having been taken before the expiry;\n\t\t\tmake any other provision for the purposes of this section.\n\t\tSubject to any provision made by virtue of subsection (7), a notice ofcomplaint is a notice which\u2014\n\t\t\tspecifies the complainant\u2019s name,\n\t\t\tsets out the statement concerned and explains why it is defamatory of thecomplainant,\n\t\t\tspecifies where on the website the statement was posted, and\n\t\t\tcontains such other information as may be specified in regulations.\n\t\tRegulations may make provision about the circumstances in which a noticewhich is not a notice of complaint is to be treated as a notice of complaintfor the purposes of this section or any provision made under it.\n\t\tRegulations under this section\u2014\n\t\t\tmay make different provision for different circumstances;\n\t\t\tare to be made by statutory instrument.\n\t\tA statutory instrument containing regulations under this section may not bemade unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before, and approved by aresolution of, each House of Parliament.\n\t\tIn this section \u201cregulations\u201d means regulations made by the Secretary ofState.\n\t\tThe defence under this section is defeated if the claimant shows that theoperator of the website has acted with malice in relation to the posting ofthe statement concerned.\n\t\tThe defence under this section is not defeated by reason only of the factthat the operator of the website moderates the statements posted on it byothers.\n\tPeer-reviewed statement in scientific or academic journal etc\n\t\tThe publication of a statement in a scientific or academic journal (whetherpublished in electronic form or otherwise) is privileged if the followingconditions are met.\n\t\tThe first condition is that the statement relates to a scientific oracademic matter.\n\t\tThe second condition is that before the statement was published in thejournal an independent review of the statement\u2019s scientific or academic meritwas carried out by\u2014\n\t\t\tthe editor of the journal, and\n\t\t\tone or more persons with expertise in the scientific or academic matterconcerned.\n\t\tWhere the publication of a statement in a scientific or academic journal isprivileged by virtue of subsection (1), the publication in the same journal ofany assessment of the statement\u2019s scientific or academic merit is alsoprivileged if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe assessment was written by one or more of the persons who carried outthe independent review of the statement; and\n\t\t\tthe assessment was written in the course of that review.\n\t\tWhere the publication of a statement or assessment is privileged by virtueof this section, the publication of a fair and accurate copy of, extract fromor summary of the statement or assessment is also privileged.\n\t\tA publication is not privileged by virtue of this section if it is shown tobe made with malice.\n\t\tNothing in this section is to be construed\u2014\n\t\t\tas protecting the publication of matter the publication of which isprohibited by law;\n\t\t\tas limiting any privilege subsisting apart from this section.\n\t\tThe reference in subsection (3)(a) to \u201cthe editor of the journal\u201d is to beread, in the case of a journal with more than one editor, as a reference tothe editor or editors who were responsible for deciding to publish thestatement concerned.\n\tReports etc protected by privilege\n\t\tFor subsection (3) of
