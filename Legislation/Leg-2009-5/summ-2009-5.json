    "summary": "The Industry and Exports (Financial Support) Act 2009 helps businesses in the UK by providing more money for them to grow and export their products or services. Before this law was made, the government could only give up to \u00a310,000 million in financial support, but now they can give up to \u00a312,000 million. This means that more businesses will have access to the funds they need to succeed. Additionally, the law allows financial help for supplies of goods and services to foreign buyers, both in the past and in the future. This means that businesses that have already exported goods or services can also get financial support. The law also gives the Secretary of State the power to make arrangements for financial assistance in connection with exports of goods and services. This means that the government can provide financial support for specific industries or companies that are doing well in exports. Overall, this law is designed to help British businesses grow and become more competitive in the global marketplace.",
