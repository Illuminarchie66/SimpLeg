    "summary": "The Health Protection Agency Act 2004 is a law that gives the Health Protection Agency (HPA) powers to keep communities safe from infectious diseases and other health threats. The HPA can provide assistance to others who perform health-related tasks and has other functions assigned to it by the Secretary of State or the National Assembly. The HPA cannot move its functions to itself via these instructions, nor can it stop someone else from doing them. It can collaborate with other groups that handle comparable obligations regarding wellbeing, regardless of where they are found. The HPA must work effectively and reasonably, and the proper power can give guidelines about its strategies. The HPA can distribute data and supplies, create and utilize intellectual property, and enter into contracts. The HPA must follow the Data Protection Act when disclosing information. The HPA can only publish information that serves the public interest and abides by data protection laws. The HPA can transfer assets, rights, and liabilities to other entities. The HPA can receive directions in writing, which can be changed later. Any healthcare provided by or for the HPA must match the standards set for English NHS bodies. The HPA must implement the changes made in Schedule 3 of the bill, and the Secretary of State can make orders to deal with the consequences of implementing the act."
