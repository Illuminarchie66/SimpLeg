    "summary": "The National Heritage Act of 2002 helps protect underwater historical sites in English waters. This law gives the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England more power over these sites, allowing them to manage and preserve them better. They can also create and sell items related to these sites, like souvenirs, and offer help and resources to other groups working to protect our cultural heritage. Additionally, the commission can explore and maintain protected shipwrecks, providing financial aid for surveys, excavations, removal, and upkeep. Finally, the act allows the commission to profit from intellectual property associated with historical structures and vessels. In short, this law ensures that important historical sites in English waters are safeguarded and preserved for future generations.",
