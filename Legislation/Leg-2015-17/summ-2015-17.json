    "summary": "The Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 helps people who want to build their own homes or custom-made houses by requiring local authorities to keep a register of interested individuals and groups. This register will help these authorities identify potential self-builders and give them priority access to land and resources. The law also ensures that local authorities consider the needs of self-builders when making decisions about planning and development.\nThis means that if you're someone who wants to build your own home, you may be able to get access to land and resources more easily, and local authorities will take your needs into account when making decisions about development in your area.",
