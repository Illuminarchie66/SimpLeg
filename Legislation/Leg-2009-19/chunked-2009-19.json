\n\t\t  * \u201crenewable or low-carbon source\u201d means a source of energy or technology specified in section 82(7) of the Energy Act 2004. \nMicrogeneration: dwellinghouses\n\tThe Secretary of State must amend the Town and Country Planning (GeneralPermitted Development) Order 1995 ([S.I.1995/418](/id/uksi/1995/418?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\")) (the\u201cGPDO\u201d), in relation to England, to provide for the grant of planningpermission for specified classes of equipment for microgeneration on, orwithin the curtilage of, a dwellinghouse.\n\tThe classes of equipment for microgeneration specified by virtue ofsubsection (1) must be or include wind turbines and air source heat pumps.\n\t\u201cSpecified\u201d in subsections (1) and (2) means specified in the GPDO.\n\tThe amendment mentioned in subsection (1) must be made within 6 monthsbeginning with the coming into force of this Act.\n\tProvision by virtue of subsection (1) may grant planning permission subjectto limitations, exceptions or conditions.\n\tThe Secretary of State must review the effect of the amendment of the GPDOas soon as reasonably practicable after the end of 2 years beginning with thedate on which the amendment comes into force.\n\tIn this section \u201cmicrogeneration\u201d has the meaning given by section 82 ofthe Energy Act 2004.\nMicrogeneration: non-domestic land\n\tThe Secretary of State must consider amending the GPDO for the purpose offacilitating the installation of equipment for microgeneration on non-domesticland in England.\n\tIn subsection (1) \u201cnon-domestic land\u201d means buildings, or other land, otherthan a dwellinghouse or land within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse.\n\tConsideration under subsection (1) must begin within 6 months beginningwith the coming into force of this Act.\n\tThe Secretary of State must, as soon as reasonably practicable, lay areport before Parliament setting out the outcome of the consideration undersubsection (1).\n\tIn considering what, if any, amendments should be made to the GPDO, theSecretary of State\u2014\n\t\tmust have regard to the results of any relevant consultation which has beencarried out by the Secretary of State in relation to the GPDO;
