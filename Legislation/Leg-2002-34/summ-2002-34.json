    "summary": "The Employee Share Schemes Act 2002 helps employees own part of their company through a special savings plan called an employee share scheme. This law makes it easier for companies to offer these plans to their workers. The law also makes sure that the plans are fair and safe for everyone involved.\nUnder this law, employers can deduct some of their contributions to the plan from their taxes. However, they have to follow certain rules to qualify for these deductions. For example, they must hold onto the shares they buy through the plan for at least a few years before they can sell them. If they don't follow these rules, they might have to give back any deductions they received.\nAdditionally, the law sets out rules for who can be trustees of the plan, such as professionals like accountants or non-professionals like regular employees. It also limits how often trustees can sell the shares they acquire through the plan. Overall, the Employee Share Schemes Act 2002 helps employees save money and invest in their company's success while protecting their rights and interests.",
