    "summary": "The National Insurance Contributions (Rate Ceilings) Act 2015 sets limits on how much you have to pay in National Insurance (NI) if you're working in the UK. This means that the government can't take too much of your money in NI contributions.\nHere's what the law does:\n\u2022 It says that the most you'll ever pay in NI is 12% of your earnings (the \"main primary percentage\") and 2% more if you earn over a certain amount (the \"additional primary percentage\").\n\u2022 It also sets a limit on another type of NI called the \"secondary percentage\" - this can't be more than 13.8%.\n\u2022 The law only applies to tax years starting after it became law and before the next general election.\n\u2022 The law uses rules from other laws passed in 1992 to work out the rates and limits for NI.\nSo, basically, the law stops the government taking too much of your money in NI contributions, making sure you keep enough of your hard-earned cash.",
