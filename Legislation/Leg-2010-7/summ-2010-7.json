It helps these groups, called \"co-operatives\" or \"community benefit societies,\" to follow rules and regulations so they can operate fairly and safely. The law also makes sure that the people who run these groups, called \"directors,\" are trustworthy and don't do anything illegal. Additionally, the law allows these groups to offer financial services, like loans and savings accounts, to their members. Overall, the purpose of this law is to support communities by giving them tools to help themselves.",
