brought intoaccount by a company for tax purposes in respect of an intangible fixed assetthat is a restricted asset.\n\t\tSections 900B to 900D make provision determining when an intangible fixedasset of a company is a restricted asset for the purposes of this Chapter.\n\t\tSections 900E and 900F contain the special rules.\n\t\tThe following sections contain supplementary provisions\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 900G (meaning of relieving acquisition),\n\t\t\tsection 900H (when two persons are related), and\n\t\t\tsection 900I (acquisition of asset in pursuance of an unconditionalobligation).\n\tWhen an intangible fixed asset is a restricted asset\n\tBWhen an intangible fixed asset is a restricted asset: the firstcase\n\t\tAn intangible fixed asset of a company is a restricted asset if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe company acquired the asset on or after 1 July 2020,\n\t\t\tthe company acquired the asset from a person who at the time of theacquisition was a related party in relation to the company, and\n\t\t\tthe asset is within subsection (2) or (3).\n\t\tThe asset is within this subsection if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe asset was a pre-FA 2002 asset in the hands of any company on 1 July2020, and\n\t\t\tat no time on or after 1 July 2020 has the asset been the subject of arelieving acquisition.\n\t\tThe asset is within this subsection if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe asset was created before 1 April 2002,\n\t\t\timmediately before 1 July 2020 the asset was held by a person other than acompany, and\n\t\t\tat no time on or after 1 July 2020 has the asset been the subject of arelieving acquisition.\n\t\tBut the asset is not within subsection (3) if the person mentioned in thatsubsection (\u201cthe intermediary\u201d) acquired the asset on or after 1 April 2002from a person (\u201cthe third party\u201d) who meets the conditions in subsections (5),(6) and (7).\n\t\tThe third party meets the condition in this subsection if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe third party is not a company, or\n\t\t\tthe third party is a company in relation to which the intermediary is not arelated party at the time of the intermediary\u2019s acquisition.\n\t\tThe third party meets the condition in this subsection if at the time ofthe intermediary\u2019s acquisition the third party is not a related party inrelation to a company in relation to which the intermediary is a relatedparty.\n\t\tThe third party meets the condition in this subsection if at the time ofthe acquisition of the asset by the company mentioned in subsection (1) thethird party is not a related party in relation to that company.\n\tCWhen an intangible fixed asset is a restricted asset: the secondcase\n\t\tAn intangible fixed asset of a company (\u201cthe asset concerned\u201d) is arestricted asset if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe company acquired the asset concerned on or after 1 July 2020,\n\t\t\tthe company acquired the asset concerned from a person who at the time ofthe acquisition was a related party in relation to the company, and\n\t\t\tthe asset concerned is within subsection (2).\n\t\tThe asset concerned is within this subsection if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe asset concerned was created on or after 1 July 2020,\n\t\t\tat no time has the asset concerned been the subject of a relievingacquisition,\n\t\t\tthe value of the asset concerned derives in whole or in part from anotherasset (\u201cthe other asset\u201d), and\n\t\t\tthe other asset was a pre-FA 2002 asset or a restricted asset in the handsof any company on the date the asset concerned was created.\n\t\tThe condition in subsection (2)(d) is to be treated as met if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe other asset was held by a person other than a company on the date theasset concerned was created,\n\t\t\ton the date the asset concerned was created that person was a related partyin relation to a company, and\n\t\t\tthe other asset would have been a pre-FA 2002 asset or a restricted assetin the hands of that company on the date the asset concerned was created hadthat company acquired the other asset from that person immediately before thatdate.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section the cases in which the value of an assetmay be derived from any other asset include any case where\u2014\n\t\t\tassets have been merged or divided,\n\t\t\tassets have changed their nature, or\n\t\t\trights or interests in or over assets have been created or extinguished.\n\tDWhen an intangible fixed asset is a restricted asset: the thirdcase\n\t\tAn intangible fixed asset of a company (\u201cthe asset concerned\u201d) is arestricted asset if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe company acquired the asset concerned on or after 1 July 2020, and\n\t\t\tthe asset concerned is within subsection (2).\n\t\tThe asset concerned is within this subsection if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe asset concerned was acquired by any company on or after 1 July 2020directly or indirectly as a consequence of, or otherwise in connection with,the realisation by another person of an asset (\u201cthe other asset\u201d),\n\t\t\tthat company and that other person were related parties at the time of therealisation of the other asset,\n\t\t\tthe other asset was a pre-FA 2002 asset or a restricted asset in the handsof any company at any time during the period beginning with 1 July 2020 andending with the time of the realisation mentioned in paragraph (a),\n\t\t\tthe other asset was not the subject of a relieving acquisition at any timeduring the period beginning with 1 July 2020 and ending with the time of therealisation mentioned in paragraph (a), and\n\t\t\tthe asset concerned has not been the subject of a relieving acquisition atany time after the realisation mentioned in paragraph (a).\n\t\tThe condition in subsection (2)(c) is to be treated as met if\u2014\n\t\t\timmediately before 1 July 2020 the other asset was held by a person thatwas not a company,\n\t\t\timmediately before 1 July 2020 that person was a related party in relationto a company, and\n\t\t\tthe other asset would have been a pre-FA 2002 asset in the hands of thatcompany on 1 July 2020 had that company acquired the asset from that personimmediately before that date.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (2) it does not matter whether\u2014\n\t\t\tthe other asset is the same as the asset concerned,\n\t\t\tthe asset concerned is acquired at the time of the realisation of the otherasset, or\n\t\t\tthe asset concerned is acquired by merging assets or otherwise.\n\tThe special rules\n\tESpecial rule: section 900B case\n\t\tThis section applies in respect of a restricted asset of a company if it isa restricted asset by reason of section 900B.\n\t\tIf the company was the first company to acquire the asset on or after 1July 2020, the relevant Chapters of this Part have effect as if the companyacquired the asset at no cost.\n\t\tIf the company was not the first company to acquire the asset on or after 1July 2020, the relevant Chapters of this Part have effect as if the companyacquired the asset for the adjusted amount.\n\t\tThe adjusted amount is\u2014\n\t\t\tA \u2212 B\n\t\twhere\u2014\n\t\t\t  * A is the amount of consideration\u2014\n\t\t\tfor which the company actually acquired the asset, or\n\t\t\tif different, for which it would (ignoring this section) be treated for thepurposes of the Taxes Acts as having acquired the asset, and\n\t\t\t\t  * B is the market value of the asset on the date it was first acquired by a company on or after 1 July 2020.\n\t\tWhere B is greater than A the adjusted amount is nil.\n\t\tIn this section\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cmarket value\u201d, in relation to an asset, means the price the asset might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale in the open market, and\n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe relevant Chapters of this Part\u201d means\u2014\n\t\t\tChapter 3 (debits in respect of intangible fixed assets),\n\t\t\tChapter 15 (adjustments on change of accounting policy), and\n\t\t\tChapter 5 (calculation of tax written-down value) in so far as it has effectfor the purposes of Chapters 3 and 15.\n\tFSpecial rule: section 900C or 900D case\n\t\tThis section applies in respect of a restricted asset of a company if it isa restricted asset by reason of section 900C or 900D.\n\t\tThe relevant Chapters of this Part have effect as if the company acquiredthe asset for the adjusted amount.\n\t\tThe adjusted amount is calculated as follows\u2014\n\t\t\t  * _Step 1_\n\t\t\tFind the amount\u2014\n\t\t\tfor which the company actually acquired the asset, or\n\t\t\tif different, for which it would (ignoring this section) be treated for thepurposes of the Taxes Acts as having acquired the asset.\n\t\t\t\t  * _Step 2_\n\t\t\tDeduct from the amount found at Step 1 such proportion of the notionaldeduction amount for the relevant other asset or each relevant other asset asis just and reasonable in the circumstances.\n\t\tWhere the deduction at Step 2 results in a negative value the adjustedamount is nil.\n\t\tIn subsection (3)\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201crelevant other asset\u201d means an asset by reference to which the conditions in paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 900C(2) or (as the case may be) the conditions in section 900D(2) were met, and\n\t\t\t  * \u201cthe notional deduction amount\u201d, in relation to a relevant other asset, means\u2014\n\t\t\tin a case where section 900E(2) would have applied had the company acquiredthe relevant other asset instead of the restricted asset, an amount equal tothe market value of the relevant other asset at the time the restricted assetwas acquired, and\n\t\t\tin a case where section 900E(3) would have applied had the company acquiredthe relevant other asset instead of the restricted asset, an amount equal tothe market value of the relevant other asset at the time it was first acquiredby a company on or after 1 July 2020, and\n\t\t\tin a case where subsection (2) of this section would have applied had thecompany acquired the relevant other asset instead of the restricted asset, theamount that would have been deducted at step 2 of subsection (3) of thissection if the company had acquired the relevant other asset instead of therestricted asset.\n\t\tIn this section \u201cmarket value\u201d and \u201cthe relevant Chapters of this Part\u201dhave the same meaning as in section 900E.\n\tSupplementary provisions\n\tGMeaning of \u201crelieving acquisition\u201d\n\t\tFor the purposes of this Chapter, an asset is the subject of a relievingacquisition if it is acquired by a company from a person who at the time ofthe acquisition is not a related party in relation to the company.\n\tHSupplementary provision about when two persons are related\n\t\tReferences in this Chapter to one person being a related party in relationto another person are to be read as including references to the participationcondition being met as between those persons.\n\t\tReferences in subsection (1) to a person include a firm in a case where,for section 1259 purposes, references in this Chapter to a company are read asreferences to the firm.\n\t\tIn subsection (2) \u201csection 1259 purposes\u201d means the purposes of determiningunder section 1259 the amount of profits or losses to be allocated to apartner in a firm.\n\t\tSection 148 of TIOPA 2010 (when the participation condition is met) appliesfor the purposes of subsection (1) as it applies for the purposes of section147(1)(b) of TIOPA 2010.\n\tIAcquisition of asset in pursuance of an unconditional obligation\n\t\tA company that acquires an intangible fixed asset in pursuance of anunconditional obligation under a contract is to be treated for the purposes ofthis Chapter as having acquired the asset on the date on which the companybecame subject to that obligation or (if later) the date on which thatobligation became unconditional.\n\t\tAn obligation is unconditional if it may not be varied or extinguished bythe exercise of a right (whether under contract or otherwise)."
