    "summary": "The Non-Domestic Rating (Lists) Act 2021 is a law that changes when non-domestic rating lists must be made up in England and Wales. These lists show which properties have to pay business rates. Before, the lists had to be done at different times of the year depending on where the property was located. Now, all non-domestic rating lists will need to be finished by April 1st, 2023. This means that everyone will know how much they owe in business rates at the same time. Additionally, the law changes when proposals for these lists need to be sent to the people who collect the taxes and the government. Instead of having to send them in at different times, now all proposals will need to be sent in by April 1st, 2023. This will help make sure that everyone knows what they owe and can plan their finances better.",
