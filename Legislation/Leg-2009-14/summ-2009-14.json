This includes reporting each year on which proposals have been implemented, why some proposals were not implemented, and any future plans for dealing with unimplemented proposals. Additionally, the government and the Law Commission can create a plan for how they will work together, which must be shared with Parliament. Overall, this law helps keep the legal system up-to-date and effective.",
