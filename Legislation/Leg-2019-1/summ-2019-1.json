    "summary": "The Finance Act 2019 is an act passed by the UK parliament to change the tax laws in the country. It covers various aspects of taxation, including income tax, corporation tax, value added tax, and carbon emissions tax. Some key changes include simplifying the tax system for employees, making it easier for businesses and charities to access tax relief, and introducing a new carbon emissions tax to encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The act also includes provisions for the treatment of decommissioning expenditure in relation to transfers of interests in oil fields, and changes to the rules for small trades of charitable trusts and companies. Additionally, the act exempts mineralogical and metallurgical processes from the Climate Change Levy, and updates the landfill tax rates."
