particular circumstances,\n\t\t\tproviding advice and assistance in relation to legal proceedings,\n\t\t\tproviding other advice and assistance in relation to the prevention ofdisputes about legal rights or duties (\u201clegal disputes\u201d) or the settlement orother resolution of legal disputes, and\n\t\t\tproviding advice and assistance in relation to the enforcement of decisionsin legal proceedings or other decisions by which legal disputes are resolved.\n\t\tThe services described in subsection (1) include, in particular, advice andassistance in the form of\u2014\n\t\t\trepresentation, and\n\t\t\tmediation and other forms of dispute resolution.\n\t\tIn this Part \u201ccivil legal services\u201d means any legal services other than thetypes of advice, assistance and representation that are required to be madeavailable under sections 13, 15 and 16 (criminal legal aid).\n\tGeneral cases\n\t\tCivil legal services are to be available to an individual under this Partif\u2014\n\t\t\tthey are civil legal services described in Part 1 of Schedule 1, and\n\t\t\tthe Director has determined that the individual qualifies for the servicesin accordance with this Part (and has not withdrawn the determination).\n\t\tThe Lord Chancellor may by order\u2014\n\t\t\tadd services to Part 1 of Schedule 1, or\n\t\t\tvary or omit services described in that Part,\n\t\t\t\t(whether by modifying that Part or Part 2, 3 or 4 of the Schedule).\n\tExceptional cases\n\t\tCivil legal services other than services described in Part 1 of Schedule 1are to be available to an individual under this Part if subsection (2) or (4)is satisfied.\n\t\tThis subsection is satisfied where the Director\u2014\n\t\t\thas made an exceptional case determination in relation to the individualand the services, and\n\t\t\thas determined that the individual qualifies for the services in accordancewith this Part,\n\t\t\t\t(and has not withdrawn either determination).\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (2), an exceptional case determination is adetermination\u2014\n\t\t\tthat it is necessary to make the services available to the individual underthis Part because failure to do so would be a breach of\u2014\n\t\t\tthe individual\u2019s Convention rights (within the meaning of the Human RightsAct 1998), or\n\t\t\tany rights of the individual to the provision of legal services that areenforceable EU rights, or\n\t\t\tthat it is appropriate to do so, in the particular circumstances of thecase, having regard to any risk that failure to do so would be such a breach.\n\t\tThis subsection is satisfied where\u2014\n\t\t\tthe services consist of advocacy in proceedings at an inquest under theCoroners Act 1988 into the death of a member of the individual\u2019s family,\n\t\t\tthe Director has made a wider public interest determination in relation tothe individual and the inquest, and\n\t\t\tthe Director has determined that the individual qualifies for the servicesin accordance with this Part,\n\t\t\t(and neither determination has been withdrawn).\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (4), a wider public interest determinationis a determination that, in the particular circumstances of the case, theprovision of advocacy under this Part for the individual for the purposes ofthe inquest is likely to produce significant benefits for a class of person,other than the individual and the members of the individual\u2019s family.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section an individual is a member of anotherindividual\u2019s family if\u2014\n\t\t\tthey are relatives (whether of the full blood or half blood or by marriageor civil partnership),\n\t\t\tthey are cohabitants (as defined in Part 4 of the Family Law Act 1996), or\n\t\t\tone has parental responsibility for the other.\n\tQualifying for civil legal aid\n\t\tThe Director must determine whether an individual qualifies under this Partfor civil legal services in accordance with\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 21 (financial resources) and regulations under that section, and\n\t\t\tcriteria set out in regulations made under this paragraph.\n\t\tIn setting the criteria, the Lord Chancellor\u2014\n\t\t\tmust consider the circumstances in which it is appropriate to make civillegal services available under this Part, and\n\t\t\tmust, in particular, consider the extent to which the criteria ought toreflect the factors in subsection (3).\n\t\tThose factors are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe likely cost of providing the services and the benefit which may beobtained by the services being provided,\n\t\t\tthe availability of resources to provide the services,\n\t\t\tthe appropriateness of applying those resources to provide the services,having regard to present and likely future demands for the provision of civillegal services under this Part,\n\t\t\tthe importance for the individual of the matters in relation to which theservices would be provided,\n\t\t\tthe nature and seriousness of the act, omission, circumstances or othermatter in relation to which the services are sought,\n\t\t\tthe availability to the individual of services provided other than underthis Part and the likelihood of the individual being able to make use of suchservices,\n\t\t\tif the services are sought by the individual in relation to a dispute, theindividual\u2019s prospects of success in the dispute,\n\t\t\tthe conduct of the individual in connection with services made availableunder this Part or an application for such services,\n\t\t\tthe conduct of the individual in connection with any legal proceedings orother proceedings for resolving disputes about legal rights or duties, and\n\t\t\tthe public interest.\n\t\tIn setting the criteria, the Lord Chancellor must seek to secure that, incases in which more than one form of civil legal service could be provided foran individual, the individual qualifies under this Part for the form ofservice which in all the circumstances is the most appropriate having regardto the criteria.\n\t\tThe criteria must reflect the principle that, in many disputes, mediationand other forms of dispute resolution are more appropriate than legalproceedings.\n\t\tRegulations under subsection (1)(b) may provide that no criteria apply inrelation to a prescribed description of individual or services.\n\tDeterminations \n\t\tA determination by the Director that an individual qualifies under thisPart for civil legal services must specify\u2014\n\t\t\tthe type of services, and\n\t\t\tthe matters in relation to which the services are to be available.\n\t\tRegulations may make provision about the making and withdrawal ofdeterminations under sections 9 and 10.\n\t\tRegulations under subsection (2) may, in particular, include\u2014\n\t\t\tprovision about the form and content of determinations and applications fordeterminations,\n\t\t\tprovision permitting or requiring applications and determinations to bemade and withdrawn in writing, by telephone or by other prescribed means,\n\t\t\tprovision setting time limits for applications and determinations,\n\t\t\tprovision for a determination to be disregarded for the purposes of thisPart if made in response to an application that is made otherwise than inaccordance with the regulations,\n\t\t\tprovision about conditions which must be satisfied by an applicant before adetermination is made,\n\t\t\tprovision about the circumstances in which a determination may or must bewithdrawn,\n\t\t\tprovision requiring information and documents to be provided,\n\t\t\tprovision requiring individuals who are the subject of a determination tobe informed of the reasons for making or withdrawing the determination, and\n\t\t\tprovision for giving information to individuals who do not qualify forcivil legal services under this Part about alternative ways of obtaining orfunding civil legal services.\n\t\tThe circumstances prescribed under subsection (3)(f) may, in particular,relate to whether the individual who is the subject of the determination hascomplied with requirements imposed by or under this Part.\n\t\tRegulations under subsection (2) must make provision establishingprocedures for the review of determinations under sections 9 and 10 and of thewithdrawal of such determinations.\n\t\tRegulations under subsection (2) may make provision for appeals to a court,tribunal or other person against such determinations and against thewithdrawal of such determinations."
