    "general": "The Commons Act 2006 is a law that helps protect and manage common land and village greens in England and Wales. Common land is land that is owned by the community, rather than by an individual or organization. Village greens are pieces of land within a village that are used for recreation or other community purposes. The law makes sure that these spaces are protected and can be enjoyed by the local community for generations to come. It also gives local authorities the power to make decisions about how the land is managed and maintained.",
