They must think about more than just the cost when choosing who will provide these services. This helps ensure that taxpayer money is being used to create positive outcomes for society as a whole.",

    "summary": "The Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012 ensures that when public bodies buy goods or services, they think about how it will benefit the local community economically, socially, and environmentally. This means that public bodies will prioritize buying from suppliers who can demonstrate positive outcomes for society and the environment, rather than just choosing the cheapest option. For example, if a council is buying new computers for its schools, it might choose a supplier who can show that their products are made locally, reducing transport emissions and supporting the local economy. Additionally, the act allows public bodies to ignore some of the requirements if there is an urgent need to arrange the procurement, such as during a pandemic. However, even if a public body ignores some of the requirements, it doesn't make everything they do invalid. Some public bodies are also exempt from certain parts of the act, like the Welsh Ministers, the First Minister for Wales, and the Counsel General to the Welsh Assembly Government. Overall, the goal of the act is to ensure that public money is spent in a way that benefits everyone in the community, not just the bottom line.",
