    "summary": "The Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Act 2021 is a new law passed by the UK government to protect military personnel who served in overseas operations. The law makes it harder for prosecutors to charge military personnel for certain crimes they may have committed while serving abroad. It also limits the amount of time military personnel have to take legal action against the government for personal injuries or death related to their service. Additionally, the law gives the UK government the power to change existing laws to better support veterans and service personnel. This means that the government can make new rules or regulations to help these individuals without having to pass a whole new law."
