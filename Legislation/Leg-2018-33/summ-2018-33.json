    "summary": "The Courts and Tribunals (Judiciary and Functions of Staff) Act 2018 helps improve the way courts and tribunals work by allowing judges to be sent to different courts and tribunals, like the Crown Court, and giving the Lord Chief Justice more power over who does what job within those courts and tribunals. It also simplifies some job titles so they're easier to understand, like changing \"Chief Bankruptcy Registrar\" to \"Chief Insolvency and Companies Court Judge.\" Additionally, this law lets certain court and tribunal employees give legal advice to judges and do jobs that were previously only done by judges themselves. This means that cases can be handled more efficiently and effectively, making sure everyone gets a fair trial.",
