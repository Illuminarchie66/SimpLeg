    "summary": "The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act of 2011 has introduced significant changes to the way police services are governed and managed in England and Wales. The act established the position of Police and Crime Commissioner, who is elected by the public to oversee the police force and set the strategic direction for policing in their area. The commissioner is responsible for managing the finances of the police force, including setting the precept (a tax on dwellings in the police area) and determining the amount of funding received from central government. They must also work with other authorities to provide an efficient and effective criminal justice system for their area. The act also sets out the functions of the police and crime commissioner, including the power to direct the chief constable to take specific actions. Additionally, the act introduces a new system for licensing premises that sell alcohol between midnight and 6am, requiring them to pay a late-night levy to help fund police services. It also increases the fine for selling alcohol to underage individuals and allows for longer closure periods for repeat offenders. Furthermore, the act gives local authorities the power to suspend licenses or certificates for failing to pay annual fees, and makes it easier for them to replace outdated policies with new ones. Overall, the act seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of police services in England and Wales."
