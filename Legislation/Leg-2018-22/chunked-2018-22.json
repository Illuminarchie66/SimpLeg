that may bemade by the regulations\u2014\n\t\t\tprovision requiring persons to be eligible for appointment as Customsagents only if an HMRC officer has approved the appointment, and\n\t\t\tprovision specifying the criteria for approving the appointment (includingprovision for the criteria to be specified in a public notice given by HMRCCommissioners).\n\tAuthorised economic operators\n\t\tHMRC Commissioners may by regulations make provision\u2014\n\t\t\tdisapplying or simplifying specified requirements made by or under thisPart in relation to things required or authorised to be done by authorisedeconomic operators, or\n\t\t\trequiring HMRC to have regard to the status of a person as an authorisedeconomic operator when considering whether or not, or how, to exercise anypower or other function for the purposes of this Part.\n\t\tFor this purpose \u201cauthorised economic operators\u201d means persons authorisedin accordance with provision made by or under the regulations.\n\t\tRegulations under this section may (for example)\u2014\n\t\t\tspecify the criteria to be applied in determining whether or not any personshould be an authorised economic operator,\n\t\t\tspecify those criteria by reference to professional standards of competence(as set by any specified person) or by reference to anything else (includingthe judgment of any person as to suitability),\n\t\t\tmake provision for a person\u2019s status as an authorised economic operator tobe subject to compliance with conditions specified in the regulations or inthe authorisation, and\n\t\t\testablish different classes of authorised economic operator.\n\tApprovals and authorisations granted under regulations\n\t\tThis section applies in relation to approvals granted to any person underregulations made under this Part (whether in respect of premises or anythingelse) unless the regulations in question make alternative provision.\n\t\tIn this section references to an approval include an authorisation.\n\t\tThe regulations under which an approval is granted may\u2014\n\t\t\trequire an application for approval to be made in a specified form and in aspecified manner and to contain specified information,\n\t\t\tspecify cases in which an application for approval may not be made,\n\t\t\trequire HMRC to consider, within a specified period, whether or not anapplication, or purported application, for approval is, as a result ofprovision made by paragraph (a) or (b), one that falls to be determined,\n\t\t\tconfer on the applicant a right of appeal to an appeal tribunal in a casewhere HMRC have failed to comply with paragraph (c),\n\t\t\trequire HMRC to notify a person making a purported application for approvalthat, as a result of provision made by paragraph (a) or (b), the purportedapplication does not fall to be determined, and\n\t\t\tmake further provision about the notification.\n\t\tThe provision that may be made under subsection (3)(d) includes\u2014\n\t\t\tprovision for an appeal to be brought only if a period specified in theregulations has ended, and\n\t\t\tprovision limiting the power of an appeal tribunal to the power to directHMRC, in a case where it is satisfied that HMRC have acted unreasonably, toconsider the application as mentioned in subsection (3)(c) within such furtherperiod as is specified by the tribunal.\n\t\tAn approval granted by HMRC is treated as if it had never been granted if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe (purported) application for approval was deficient in some respect,\n\t\t\tthe applicant knew, or ought reasonably to have known, of the deficiency,\n\t\t\tHMRC consider that the approval would not have been granted if thedeficiency was known at the time it was granted by the person granting it, and\n\t\t\tHMRC give a notice to the applicant under this subsection notifying theapplicant of the effect of this subsection.\n\t\tRegulations made by HMRC Commissioners may make any provision that theyconsider appropriate for the purposes of subsection (5), including provisionspecifying cases in which the approval is to continue to be treated as stillin force.\n\t\tAn approval may be amended, suspended or revoked in cases specified in theregulations under which it was granted.\n\t\tThe amendment, suspension or revocation of an approval takes effect fromthe date specified in a notice given by HMRC to the person approved (and,accordingly, does not affect anything already done by any person before thatdate in reliance on the approval).\n\t\tHMRC\u2014 \n\t\t\tmay not specify a date before the notice is given unless HMRC and theperson both agree that such a date may be given, and\n\t\t\tmay not specify a date that falls more than one year after the date onwhich the notice is given.\n\t\tIn this section \u201can appeal tribunal\u201d has the same meaning as in Chapter 2of Part 1 of the Finance Act 1994 (see section 7).\n\tRulings as to application of customs tariff or place of origin\n\t\tHMRC Commissioners must by public notice make provision establishing asystem under which persons apply for rulings given by HMRC officers for thepurpose of\u2014\n\t\t\tdetermining any issue as to the code in the customs tariff applicable toany goods, or\n\t\t\tdetermining the place of origin of any goods for the purposes of this Part.\n\t\tEach of the following is an example of the kind of provision that may bemade by the notice\u2014\n\t\t\tprovision specifying cases in which rulings need not be given,\n\t\t\tprovision about the making of the applications (including their form, theinformation to be contained in them and any documents to accompany them),\n\t\t\tprovision requiring the applications to be determined within a specifiedperiod,\n\t\t\tprovision about the period for which, and other conditions subject towhich, the rulings are to have effect,\n\t\t\tprovision about the form in which the rulings are to be given,\n\t\t\tprovision for the withdrawal or amendment of rulings,\n\t\t\tprovision determining the extent to which the rulings may be relied on byapplicants, and\n\t\t\tprovision requiring any person to whom a ruling has been given to disclosethat fact to HMRC.\n\t\tThe system established by the notice must secure that an application may bemade for a ruling even if an HMRC officer considers that the ruling is not, ormay not be, required to resolve a doubt as to the issue being determined."

procedure underPart 1 of TCTA 2018.\n\t\t\tBut\u2014 \n\t\t\t\tin the case of goods declared under TCTA 2018 for a storage procedure, atransit procedure or an inward processing procedure, the goods are importedwhen a liability to import duty is, or on the relevant assumptions would be,incurred in respect of them under section 4 of that Act, and\n\t\t\t\tin the case of goods which are liable to forfeiture as a result of section5(1) of, or paragraph 1(5) or 3(4) of Schedule 1 to, that Act (goods notpresented to Customs or Customs declaration not made), the goods are importedwhen they become liable to forfeiture as a result of those provisions.\n\t\t\tEach person who is, or on the relevant assumptions would be, liable toimport duty in respect of goods imported into the United Kingdom is a personwho has imported the goods.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of this section \u201cthe relevant assumptions\u201d are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tan assumption that a liability to import duty at a nil rate is replaced bya liability to import duty at a higher rate, and\n\t\t\t\tan assumption that no relief from import duty is available.\n\t\t\tIf two or more persons are regarded as importing goods, those persons arejointly and severally liable to any VAT that is payable on the importation.\n\t\t\tThe preceding provisions of this section are to be ignored in reading anyreference to importation or to an importer in anything applied for thepurposes of this Act by section 16(1) or (2).\n\t\t\tBut subsection (7) does not apply so far as the context otherwise requiresor provision to the contrary is contained in regulations under section 16(3).\u201d\n\tEU law relating to VAT\n\t\tAny EU regulation so far as applying in relation to value added tax, andany direct EU legislation so far as relevant

value added tax, the rights, powers, liabilities, obligations,restrictions, remedies and procedures mentioned there are subject to anyexclusions or other modifications made by regulations made by the Treasury bystatutory instrument.\n\t\tFurther provision relevant to the law relating to value added tax is madeby the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018: see, for example, section 6 ofthat Act

_Halifax_ and _Kittel_ ) continues to be relevant, in accordancewith that Act, for the purposes of the law relating to value added tax.\n\t\tWhere the principal VAT directive remains relevant for

instrument containing regulations under this section must belaid before the House of Commons, and, unless approved by that House beforethe end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which theinstrument is made, ceases to have effect at the end of that period.\n\t\tThe fact that a statutory instrument ceases to have effect as mentioned insubsection (7) does not
