creating the power takes effect; but this is subject tosubsection (3).\n\t\tIf section 1(2), (3) or (4) applies and\u2014\n\t\t\tthe instrument nominates benefits under a relevant pension scheme, or\n\t\t\tthe instrument is made in the exercise of a power of advancement arisingunder a relevant pension scheme,\n\t\t\t\tthe perpetuity period starts when the member concerned became a member of thescheme.\n\t\tThe member concerned is the member in respect of whose interest in thescheme the instrument is made.\n\tWait and see rule\n\t\tSubsection (2) applies if (apart from this section and section 8) an estateor interest would be void on the ground that it might not become vested untiltoo remote a time.\n\t\tIn such a case\u2014\n\t\t\tuntil such time (if any) as it becomes established that the vesting mustoccur (if at all) after the end of the perpetuity period the estate orinterest must be treated as if it were not subject to the rule againstperpetuities, and\n\t\t\tif it becomes so established, that does not affect the validity of anythingpreviously done (whether by way of advancement, application of intermediateincome or otherwise) in relation to the estate or interest.\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies if (apart from this section) any of the followingwould be void on the ground that it might be exercised at too remote a time\u2014\n\t\t\ta right of re-entry exercisable if a condition subsequent is broken;\n\t\t\tan equivalent right exercisable in the case of property other than land ifa condition subsequent is broken;\n\t\t\ta special power of

perpetuities,and\n\t\t\tthe right or power must be treated as void for remoteness only if and sofar as it is not fully exercised within the perpetuity period.\n\t\tSubsection (6) applies if (apart from this section) a general power ofappointment would be void on the ground that it might not become exercisableuntil too remote a time.\n\t\tUntil such time (if any) as it becomes established that the power will notbe exercisable within the perpetuity period, it must be treated as if it werenot subject to the rule against perpetuities.\n\tExclusion of class members to avoid remoteness\n\t\tThis section applies if\u2014\n\t\t\tit is apparent at the time an instrument takes effect or becomes apparentat a later time that (apart from this section) the inclusion of certainpersons as members of a class would cause an estate or interest to be treatedas void for remoteness, and\n\t\t\tthose persons are potential members of the class or unborn persons who atbirth would become members or potential members of the class.\n\t\tFrom the time it is or becomes so apparent those persons must be treatedfor all the purposes of the instrument as excluded from the class unless theirexclusion would exhaust the class.\n\t\tIf this section applies in relation to an estate or interest to whichsection 7 applies, this section does not affect the validity of anythingpreviously done (whether by way of advancement, application of intermediateincome or otherwise) in relation to the estate or interest.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section\u2014\n\t\t\ta person is a member of a class if in that person\u2019s case all the conditionsidentifying a member of the class are satisfied, and\n\t\t\ta person is a potential member of a class if in that person\u2019s case someonly of those conditions are satisfied but there is a possibility that theremainder will in time be satisfied.\n\tSaving and acceleration of expectant interests\n\t\tAn estate or interest is not void for remoteness by reason only that it isulterior to and dependent on an estate or interest which is so void.\n\t\tThe vesting of an estate or interest is not prevented from beingaccelerated on the failure of a prior estate or interest by reason only thatthe failure arises because of remoteness.\n\tDeterminable interests becoming absolute\n\t\tIf an estate arising under a right of reverter on the determination of adeterminable fee simple is void for remoteness the determinable fee simplebecomes absolute.\n\t\tIf an interest arising under a resulting trust on the determination of adeterminable interest is void for remoteness the determinable interest becomesabsolute.\n\tPowers of appointment\n\t\tSubsection (2) applies to a power of appointment exercisable otherwise thanby will (whether or not it is also exercisable by will).\n\t\tFor the purposes of the rule against perpetuities the power is a specialpower unless\u2014\n\t\t\tthe instrument creating it expresses it to be exercisable by one persononly, and\n\t\t\tat all times during its currency when that person is of full age andcapacity it could be exercised by that person so as immediately to transfer tothat person the whole of the interest governed by the power without theconsent of any other person or compliance with any other condition (ignoring aformal condition relating only to the mode of exercise of the power).\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies to a power of appointment exercisable by will(whether or not it is also exercisable otherwise than by will).\n\t\tFor the purposes of the rule against perpetuities the power is a specialpower unless\u2014\n\t\t\tthe instrument creating it expresses it to be exercisable by one persononly, and\n\t\t\tthat person could exercise it so as to transfer to that person\u2019s personalrepresentatives the whole of the estate or interest to which it relates.\n\t\tSubsection (6) applies to a power of appointment exercisable by will orotherwise.\n\t\tIf for the purposes of the rule against perpetuities the power would be aspecial power under one but not both of subsections (2) and (4), for thepurposes of the rule it is a special power.\n\tPre-commencement instruments: period difficult to ascertain\n\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\tan instrument specifies for the purposes of property limited in trust aperpetuity period by reference to the lives of persons in being when theinstrument takes effect,\n\t\t\tthe trustees believe that it is difficult or not reasonably practicable forthem to ascertain whether the lives have ended and therefore whether theperpetuity period has ended, and\n\t\t\tthey execute a deed stating that they so believe and that subsection (2) isto apply to the instrument,\n\t\t\t\tthat subsection applies to the instrument.\n\t\tIf this subsection applies to an instrument\u2014\n\t\t\tthe instrument has effect as if it specified a perpetuity period of 100years (and no other period);\n\t\t\tthe rule against perpetuities has effect as if the only perpetuity periodapplicable to the instrument were 100 years;\n\t\t\tsections 6 to 11 of this Act are to be treated as if they applied (andalways applied) in relation to the instrument;\n\t\t\tsections 1 to 12 of the [Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 1964 (c.55)](/id/ukpga/1964/55?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\") are to betreated as if they did not apply (and
