    "summary": "The National Insurance Contributions (Increase of Thresholds) Act 2022 changes how much money you have to earn before you start paying certain types of national insurance. Here's what the law does:\n\n* It raises the amount you need to earn before you start paying Primary Class 1 contributions from \u00a3190 to \u00a3242. This means you won't have to pay as much national insurance if you earn less than \u00a3242 per week.\n\n* It also raises the lower limit of profits for Class 4 contributions from \u00a39,880 to \u00a311,908. This means you won't have to pay as much national insurance if you earn less than \u00a311,908 per year from self-employment.\n\n* The law allows the government to set the threshold for paying Class 2 contributions so that it's the same as the threshold for paying Class 4 contributions. This means that if you earn less than \u00a311,908 per year from self-employment, you won't have to pay Class 2 contributions either.\n\n* The law also includes some technical changes to existing rules and allows the government to make further changes through regulations if needed. These changes will help people who earn less money by reducing the amount they have to pay in national insurance contributions.",
