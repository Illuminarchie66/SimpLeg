    "summary": "The Royal Parks (Trading) Act 2000 protects London's eight Royal Parks by making it illegal to sell or trade goods within these parks without permission. This law helps keep the parks clean and safe for visitors. If someone breaks this rule, they could face fines of up to \u00a31,000 or even have their items taken away. Park rangers have the right to stop you if they think you're breaking the rules, so always check before doing any trading or selling in the parks. The government can also keep any items that were used to break the law for up to 28 days while they investigate. If you get caught, you might have to give back any money you made from selling things in the park. The goal of this law is to keep the parks beautiful and enjoyable for everyone.",
