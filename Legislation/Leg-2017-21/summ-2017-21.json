    "summary": "The Bus Services Act 2017 simplifies the process of creating better bus services by allowing local authorities to work together to improve the quality of bus services, introduce new technologies, and enhance the user experience. It enables the creation of \"advanced quality partnership schemes,\" \"joint schemes,\" \"notice schemes,\" and \"franchising schemes.\" These schemes can specify certain facilities and measures to achieve goals such as improving service quality, reducing traffic congestion, and increasing the use of local services. Additionally, the act allows for the creation of \"advanced ticketing schemes\" that require operators of local bus services to offer tickets that can be used on multiple journeys, further reducing traffic congestion and improving the use of bus services. Overall, the Bus Services Act 2017 empowers local authorities to create more effective and efficient bus services that benefit passengers and the community."
