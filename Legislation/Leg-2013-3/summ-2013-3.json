    "general": "This law makes it illegal for people who are not supposed to be living in social housing (like council houses or flats) to sublet them or give up possession of them without permission. It also gives the government more power to investigate and punish those who break these rules. This helps stop people from committing fraud by pretending to live in social housing when they don't really need it, so that more people who actually need help can get access to affordable homes.",
