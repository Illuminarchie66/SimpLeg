    "summary": "\nThe Trade Act 2021 allows the UK government to make changes to laws and regulations related to international trade without needing approval from Parliament. This means the government can quickly adapt to changing global trade policies and negotiate new deals with other countries. The act also creates an independent advisory body called the Trade Remedies Authority to provide expert advice on trade issues. Additionally, the act establishes the Trade and Agriculture Commission to advise on free trade agreements and standards, and sets up rules for sharing information about trade between different government agencies and departments. Overall, the goal of the Trade Act 2021 is to help the UK government navigate the complex world of international trade and ensure that the country remains competitive and prosperous."
