The Act sets out specific rules and procedures for conducting a recall petition, including requirements for signing the petition, deadlines for collecting signatures, and restrictions on campaign financing. If enough eligible voters sign the petition, the MP's seat becomes vacant, and a new member is elected. The Act also provides for the questioning of the outcome of the recall petition through regulations under section 18. Additionally, the UK government has the power to make changes to the election process through regulations without needing approval from parliament. These changes can include modifications, additions, or removals of provisions in existing election laws."
