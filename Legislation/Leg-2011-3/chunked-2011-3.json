by any other person, and\n\t\t\tthe business would have been prevented by subsection (2)(b) from being anew business had\u2014\n\t\t\tP begun to carry on the activities when beginning to carry on the business,and\n\t\t\tthe other person at that time ceased to carry them on.\n\t\tIn this section \u201cbusiness\u201d means something which is\u2014\n\t\t\ta trade, profession or vocation for the

to any payment of earnings to orfor the benefit of the person in respect of the employment at any time duringthe period that is the holiday period in relation to the person.\n\t\tWhere (apart from this subsection) there would be more than 10 qualifyingemployees, only the first 10 persons who become qualifying employees arequalifying employees.\n\t\tThe \u201cinitial period\u201d means the period of one year beginning with\u2014\n\t\t\tthe date on which P starts the new business, or\n\t\t\tif earlier, the first date on which a person first becomes employed as anemployed earner for the purposes of the new business,\n\t\t\t\tbut if the first date on which a person first becomes employed as an employedearner for the purposes of the new business is before 22 June 2010, the personis to be taken for the purposes of paragraph (b) as first so employed on thatdate.\n\t\tThe \u201choliday period\u201d, in relation to a person, is the period\u2014\n\t\t\tbeginning with the day on which the person first becomes employed as anemployed earner for the purposes of the new business or, if the person firstbecomes so employed before 6 September 2010, with that date, and\n\t\t\tending with

to or for the benefit of thequalifying employee, in respect of employment as an employed earner for thepurposes of the new business, at any time during the holiday period when theprincipal place at which the business is carried on is not in any of theexcluded regions.\n\t\tBut if (apart from this subsection) the relevant amount of secondary Class1 contributions would exceed \u00a35,000, it is the first \u00a35,000 which P becomesliable to pay.\n\t\tIn the case of a qualifying employee who is a mariner, the reference insubsection (3) to earnings paid at any time during the holiday periodincludes, in relation to earnings paid for a voyage beginning in the holidayperiod but ending after it, earnings earned in the part of the voyage periodfalling within the holiday period.\n\t\t\t\u201cMariner\u201d and \u201cvoyage period\u201d have the meaning given by regulation 115 of the2001 Regulations.\n\t\tIf P is liable to pay secondary Class 1 contributions at the contracted-outrate, P is to be treated for the purposes of subsection (2) as liable to paythem at the non-contracted-out rate; and for this purpose \u201ccontracted-outrate\u201d and \u201cnon-contracted-out rate\u201d have the same meaning as in the 2001Regulations.\n\tMaking of deductions or refunds\n\t\tTo the extent that the appropriate amount is attributable to secondaryClass 1 contributions payable in respect of earnings paid in a tax year it maybe deducted from any one or more Class 1 contributions payments made by P inrespect of that tax year.\n\t\tIf the amount which P would be entitled to deduct under this sectionexceeds the amount of the payments from which it can be deducted, HMRC mustinstead refund the excess to P if P requests them to do so.\n\t\tNo deduction or refund may be made under this section until an applicationhas been submitted to, and granted by, HMRC.\n\t\tAn application must contain such information, and must be made in such formand manner, as is specified by HMRC.\n\t\tNo application may be made for a refund in respect of a qualifying employeeafter the end of the period of 4 years beginning with the day on which thelast deduction could be made in respect of the qualifying employee.\n\t\tFor the purposes of\u2014\n\t\t\tPart 2 of the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc.)Act 1999, and\n\t\t\tPart 3 of the Social

decision whether P is or was entitled to make a deduction under thissection and, if so, the amount that P is or was entitled to deduct, and\n\t\t\ta decision whether P is entitled to a refund under this section and, if so,the amount of the refund.\n\tRetention of records\n\t\tThis section applies where P is or was entitled to make a deduction undersection 8 in respect of a qualifying employee.\n\t\tP must keep and preserve any documents or records relating to\u2014\n\t\t\tP\u2019s entitlement to make a deduction in respect of the employee, and\n\t\t\tthe calculation of any amount that has been, or could have been, deducted,\n\t\t\t\tfor not less than 3 years beginning with the date on which the last deductionunder section 8 is, or could be, made in respect of the employee.\n\t\tAccordingly, the duty imposed by paragraph 26(1) of Schedule 4 to the 2001Regulations (retention by employer of contribution and election records) doesnot apply to any such documents or records.\n\t\tThe duty imposed by this section may be discharged by preserving thedocuments or records in any form or by any means.\n\t\tFor the purposes of Schedule 36 to the Finance Act 2008 (information andinspection powers), as applied by section 110ZA of SSAA 1992 and section 104ZAof SSA(NI)A 1992, the duty imposed by this section is to be treated as if itwere a duty imposed under or by virtue of SSCBA 1992 or SSCB(NI)A 1992.\n\tAnti-avoidance \n\t\tThis Part does not apply if P starts the new business pursuant to avoidancearrangements.\n\t\tArrangements are \u201cavoidance arrangements\u201d if the main purpose, or one ofthe main purposes, of P in being a party to them is to secure that activitieswhich might otherwise have been carried on as part of another
