    "summary": "The National Insurance Contributions Act 2011 increases the amount of money people pay towards National Insurance if they earn over \u00a320,000 per year. This includes people who work for themselves or have a small business. The increase starts in April 2011.\nFor people who start a new business, there is a special rule that allows them to not pay National Insurance for a short time. This only applies to certain areas of the country.\nThis law also changes some of the words used to describe different things related to National Insurance.\nOverall, this law means that more money will go into the system that helps people who are sick, unemployed, or retired."
