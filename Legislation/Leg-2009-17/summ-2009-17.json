    "general": "This law allows the government to temporarily stop people from teaching others how to drive if they are not qualified or if their instructors are not properly registered. It also gives the government the power to exempt some people from these rules if necessary. Additionally, the law provides for compensation if someone is wrongly suspended. In other words, this law helps ensure that only qualified and registered driving instructors can teach others how to drive safely.",

    "summary": "The Driving Instruction (Suspension and Exemption Powers) Act 2009 helps keep people safe when learning to drive by allowing the Registrar to temporarily stop someone from teaching others how to drive if they think that person might cause harm. This could happen if the person has a lot of traffic violations, health problems, or other issues that would put others at risk. If the Registrar decides to pause the person's ability to teach driving, they will send them a letter explaining why. In some cases, the suspension might end early if the Registrar later decides that the person is safe to continue teaching driving. If the person loses money because of the suspension, they might be able to get some of that money back under certain rules.",
