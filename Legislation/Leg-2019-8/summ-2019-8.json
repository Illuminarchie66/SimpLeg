It gives drivers clear guidelines on how private parking lots should operate, like making sure there are enough signs and that the owners can't fine you too much if you accidentally park there. The goal is to protect drivers from unfair treatment by private parking lot operators.",

    "summary": "The Parking (Code of Practice) Act 2019 helps ensure fairness when dealing with private parking facilities. It requires a code of practice that provides guidance on how these facilities should operate and manage their parking spaces. This includes rules for appealing unfair parking fines. Additionally, the government can work with local authorities to enforce the code, and accredited parking associations may need to pay a fee to cover the cost of administering and investigating parking disputes. Overall, the law aims to protect consumers from unjust parking practices and promote transparency within the industry.",
    "single": "\n* The Parking Code will establish guidelines for the administration and supervision of private parking facilities.\n* It outlines the steps that must be done to ensure that parking lots are operated and managed fairly and effectively.\n* A code of conduct will be created to encourage all parking appeals to be handled by a single individual who is free of ties to those offering private parking services.\n* Levy can be recovered for covering administrative and investigation expenses.\n* Failure to comply with the code's rules might result in penalties, fines, or even the loss of accreditation.\n* The code will be examined every three years to guarantee that it remains current and efficient.\n\nPlease note that this is a complex piece of legislation, and I have simplified it as much as possible while still conveying its essential elements. Please let me know if you need further clarification or details."
