operate or manage private parking facilities,\n\t\t\tpersons who appear to the Secretary of State to represent the interests ofthose who use, or may use, private parking facilities, and\n\t\t\tsuch other persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.\n\t\tAfter preparing a code under section 1, the Secretary of State must lay thecode before Parliament.\n\t\tIf, within the 40-day period, either House of Parliament resolves not toapprove the code\u2014\n\t\t\tthe code is not to be issued, and\n\t\t\tthe Secretary of State must prepare another code under section 1.\n\t\tIf no
