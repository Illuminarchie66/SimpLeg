    "general": "This law was passed in 2003 to improve how the police work in Northern Ireland. It makes sure that people who aren't police officers can only use police powers if they have permission from the Chief Constable or a judge. This helps keep everyone safe and ensures that only authorized personnel can use these special powers. The law also changes some rules for collecting evidence so that it's easier for the police to do their job effectively.",
