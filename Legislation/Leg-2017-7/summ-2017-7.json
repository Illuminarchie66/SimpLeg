The act grants the government powers to acquire land, modify existing laws and regulations, and delegate oversight to a nominated undertaker. The act also includes provisions for environmental impact assessments, financial arrangements, and the commencement of the act. In simpler terms, the UK government has the power to build a fast train line between London and Birmingham, and can take land from people to do so. They can also change rules and laws to help with the construction."
