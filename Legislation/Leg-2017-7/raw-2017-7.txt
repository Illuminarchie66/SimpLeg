## SCHEDULE 9Acquisition of rights in land: application of compulsory purchaselegislation, 
### Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 and compensation enactments, 
1Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (referred to in this Schedule as“CPA 1965”), as applied by section 4(3) to the acquisition of land undersection 4(1), and the enactments relating to compensation for the compulsorypurchase of land, apply to a compulsory acquisition under section 4(1) byvirtue of section 5—, 
(a)with the modifications specified in paragraph 2, and, 
(b)with such other modifications as may be necessary., 
2(1)The modifications referred to in paragraph 1(a) are as follows., 
(2)References in CPA 1965 to land are, in appropriate contexts, to be read(according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, oras including references to—, 
(a)the right acquired or to be acquired or (as the case may be) therestrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed, or, 
(b)the land over which the right is, or is to be, exercisable or (as the casemay be) the restrictive covenant is, or is to be, enforceable., 
(3)For section 7 of CPA 1965 substitute—, 
#### “7Measure of compensation in case of purchase of new right or impositionof new restrictive covenant, 
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under thisAct, regard shall be had, not only to the extent (if any) to which the valueof the land over which the right is acquired or the restrictive covenant isimposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition ofthe covenant, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner ofthe land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, orinjuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferredby this or the special Act.”, 
(4)In section 8 of CPA 1965 (provisions as to divided land), for subsection(1) substitute—, 
“(1)This subsection applies where—, 
(a)a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenantaffecting, land consisting of a house, building or manufactory or of a park orgarden belonging to a house (“the relevant land”) has been served on a personunder section 5 of this Act,, 
(b)in consequence of the service of the notice, a question of disputedcompensation in respect of the acquisition of the right or imposition of thecovenant would, apart from this section, fall to be determined by the UpperTribunal, and, 
(c)before the Upper Tribunal has determined that question, the person on whomthe notice has been served satisfies the Upper Tribunal that the relevantconditions are met., 
(1A)The relevant conditions are—, 
(a)that the person has an interest which the person is able and willing tosell in the whole of the relevant land,, 
(b)where the relevant land consists of a house, building or manufactory, thatit cannot be made subject to the right or covenant without material detrimentto it, and, 
(c)where the relevant land consists of a park or garden belonging to a house,that it cannot be made subject to the right or covenant without seriouslyaffecting the amenity or convenience of the house., 
(1B)Where subsection (1) above applies—, 
(a)the compulsory purchase order shall, in relation to the person on whom thenotice to treat has been served—, 
(i)cease to authorise the acquisition of the right or imposition of thecovenant to which the notice relates, and, 
(ii)be deemed to authorise the acquisition of that person’s interest in thewhole of the relevant land including, where the land consists of a park orgarden belonging to a house, the house, and, 
(b)the notice to treat shall be deemed to have been served in respect of thatinterest on such date as the Upper Tribunal directs., 
(1C)Any question as to the extent of the land in which the compulsory purchaseorder is deemed to authorise the purchase of an interest by virtue ofsubsection (1B)(a)(ii) of this section shall be determined by the UpperTribunal., 
(1D)Where the Upper Tribunal determines that the person on whom a notice totreat has been served has satisfied the Upper Tribunal as mentioned insubsection (1)(c) of this section, the acquiring authority may withdraw thenotice at any time within the period of six weeks beginning with the date ofthe determination., 
(1E)Subsection (1D) of this section is without prejudice to any other power ofthe acquiring authority to withdraw the notice to treat.”, 
(5)The following provisions of CPA 1965 (which state the effect of a deed pollexecuted in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons withinterests in the land)—, 
  * section 9(4) (failure of owners to convey), , 
  * paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity), , 
  * paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners), and , 
  * paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land), , 
are so modified as to secure that, as against persons with interests in theland which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is tobe acquired compulsorily or the benefit of the covenant which is to be imposedis vested absolutely in the acquiring authority., 
(6)Section 11 of CPA 1965 (powers of entry) is modified so as to secure that,where the acquiring authority have served notice to treat in respect of anyright or restrictive covenant as well as the notice required by subsection (1)of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under section4(1)), they have power, exercisable in the same circumstances and subject tothe same conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right orenforcing that covenant; and sections 12 (penalty for unauthorised entry) and13 (entry on enforcement officer’s or sheriff’s warrant in the event ofobstruction) of that Act are modified accordingly., 
(7)Section 20 of CPA 1965 (compensation for short-term tenants) applies withthe modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in landas are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding tothat in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition of theland, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interferencewith such interests as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by theexercise of the right or enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question., 
(8)Section 22 of CPA 1965 (protection of acquiring authority’s possession ofland where interest accidentally omitted from purchase) is so modified as toenable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to thosereferred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the rightacquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliancewith that section as respects compensation., 
(9)In the Land Compensation Act 1973, for section 44 substitute—,
