    "general": "This law makes sure that some types of financial help for people who are struggling, like unemployment benefits or money for families with low incomes, keep up with the rising cost of living. It does this by linking these benefits to inflation, so they go up each year by a certain amount based on how prices are changing. This way, the value of these benefits doesn't get eroded over time due to inflation.",

    "summary": "The Welfare Benefits Up-rating Act 2013 helps people receiving certain types of financial support (such as Jobseeker's Allowance) keep up with the rising cost of living. The law says that these benefits will go up by 1% every year for two years, starting in 2014. This means that the value of these benefits won't fall behind because of inflation. However, if the price of things like food and housing doesn't go up at all, then the benefits might not increase that year. The government can also choose to round up or down the amount of the increase to make sure it's fair. This law only applies to certain types of benefits, such as Jobseeker's Allowance, and not to others like pensions.",
