    "summary": "The Stamp Duty Land Tax Act 2015 changes how tax is calculated when buying or selling a home. Before, there were set amounts of tax based on the price of the property. Now, the tax will be calculated using a new table that has different rates based on the price of the property. This means that the more expensive the property, the higher the tax will be. This only applies to homes, not other types of buildings. If you buy multiple homes at once, the tax will be calculated as if it was one big transaction.  ",
    "single": "\n* The Stamp Duty Land Tax Act 2015 changes the way tax is calculated on residential property transactions.\n* The new method of calculation is based on the amount of the relevant consideration for the transaction.\n* The tax rate is determined by the amount of the relevant consideration, with different rates applying to different parts of the consideration.\n* The rates are as follows:\n\t+ 0% on the first \u00a3125,000\n\t+ 2% on the next \u00a3125,000\n\t+ 5% on the next \u00a3250,000\n\t+ 10% on the next \u00a3925,000\n\t+ 12% on any amount over \u00a31,500,000\n* The new method of calculation applies to transactions where the relevant land consists entirely of residential property, and the transaction is not one of a number of linked transactions.\n* If the relevant land consists of or includes land that is not residential property, the amount of tax chargeable is determined in accordance with Table B below by reference to the amount of the relevant consideration.\n* The amendments made by this Act have effect in relation to any land transaction of which the effective date is, or is after, 4 December 2014.\n* An election can be made to apply the old method of calculation to certain transactions effected in pursuance of a contract entered into before 4 December 2014."
