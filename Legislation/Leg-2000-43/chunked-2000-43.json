by\u2014\n\t\t\t\tproviding for the board to comprise persons determined in accordance withan arrangement made between the Secretary of State and an organisation (a\u201cmanagement arrangement\u201d), and\n\t\t\t\tmaking any other modifications which appear to the Secretary of State to benecessary or expedient in consequence of that provision or of the managementarrangement.\n\t\t\tA management order may provide for the persons determined in accordancewith the management arrangement to replace all or any of the chairman, thechief officer and the other existing members of the board; and vacanciesoccurring among the replacements are to be filled in accordance with themanagement arrangement.\n\t\t\tThe power to revoke a management order is exercisable at any time when theSecretary of State considers it necessary or expedient to revoke it.\n\t\t\tOn the revocation of a management order, any person who is a member of theboard by virtue of the order and the arrangement ceases to be a
