    "general": "This act created two new services to help people who have committed crimes or are suspected of committing them. One service is called the National Probation Service and it helps adults who have been sentenced to probation instead of going to prison. The other service is called the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service and it helps children who are involved in the court system. The act also made changes to how police and courts handle people who are suspected of, charged with, or convicted of crimes. It also changed the way some information is shared between different organizations.",
