    "summary": "The Kew Gardens (Leases) Act 2019 allows the Secretary of State to rent out parts of Kew Gardens for up to 150 years. However, before doing so, they must make sure that the rental agreement won't harm the special value of Kew Gardens as a world-famous heritage site. This law only applies to England and Wales, and it goes into effect two months after it was passed. So, the Secretary of State can now rent out parts of Kew Gardens for long periods of time, as long as it doesn't hurt its importance as a heritage site.",
