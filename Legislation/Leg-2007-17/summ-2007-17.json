    "general": "This law was passed in 2007 to help protect consumers when they buy goods or services. It sets up an organization called the National Consumer Council to handle complaints about things like faulty products or poor service. The law also requires some businesses to join \"redress schemes\" which helps consumers get their money back if something goes wrong. Additionally, the law makes it easier for people to cancel contracts they made outside of a store or office. Overall, the purpose of this law is to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and have a way to resolve disputes with businesses.",

    "summary": "The Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act of 2007 is designed to protect consumers from unfair treatment by estate agents, energy providers, postal services, and water supply companies. The law creates redress schemes to handle consumer complaints and sets standards for complaint handling procedures. It also empowers regulatory bodies to enforce certain requirements set forth in Part 2 of the act, and updates existing laws regarding estate agents' duties. The law gives consumers the right to cancel contracts made with traders at their homes or workplaces, provided the contract was made during a solicited visit by the trader. Overall, the aim of the law is to improve consumer protection and redress in various industries, particularly in relation to complaint handling processes."
