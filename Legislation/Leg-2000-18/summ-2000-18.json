    "summary": "The Sea Fishing Grants (Charges) Act 2000 ensures that fees charged by the Sea Fish Industry Authority and the Herring Industry Board for managing grants given to fishermen are legitimate. This law only applies to costs incurred before May 3, 1996, and covers all of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It helps the authorities provide safer fishing boats and improve the industry.\nThis law allows the Sea Fish Industry Authority and the Herring Industry Board to charge fees when they give money to fishermen for new boats or safety improvements. These fees help pay for running the programs and making sure fishermen follow the rules. The law only goes back to May 3, 1996, so any fees charged before then are still good. This law also says that the government has the right to do this, so everyone knows who's in charge.",
