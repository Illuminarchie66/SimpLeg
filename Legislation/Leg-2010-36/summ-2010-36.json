    "general": "This law makes sure that children have money saved for them when they grow up, so they can buy things like a house or go to college. It also helps pregnant women get money to take care of their health and their baby's health during pregnancy. The law gets rid of an old program called \"Saving Gateway Accounts\" and replaces it with a new one called \"child trust fund.\" This way, more people will be able to save money for their kids and have better access to healthcare while they are pregnant.",

Here's what you need to know:\nFor babies born before 2011:\n* The law removes the eligibility for child trust funds, so if you had a baby before 2011, you might not get this type of savings account.\nFor moms-to-be:\n* If you haven't reached the 25th week of your pregnancy by 2011, you won't be able to get health in pregnancy grants.\nOther things to note:\n* The law also changes some other rules about saving money and benefits for families.\n* These changes only apply to England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.\nSo, if you're expecting a baby or have already had one, you might want to check if these changes affect you and your family's savings and benefits.",
