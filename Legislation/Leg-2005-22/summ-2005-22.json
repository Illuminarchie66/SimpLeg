    "summary": "The Finance (No. 2) Act 2005 gives the UK government power to update tax laws for fairness and efficiency. It allows the government to create new taxes or modify existing ones, and to address tax evasion and avoidance. Companies suspected of participating in tax avoidance schemes can receive notices requiring them to pay back any tax benefits received, along with penalties and interest. Additionally, the act allows for tax-neutral treatment of intangible fixed asset transfers during the formation of an SE through mergers, provided the transfer is made for bona fide commercial reasons. Finally, the act updates definitions of \"UK company\" for the purpose of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax to exclude companies that have undergone a transfer in accordance with the EU's Statute for a European Company (Societas Europaea)."
