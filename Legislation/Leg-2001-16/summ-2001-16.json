    "general": "This law was passed in 2001 to help fight crime and keep people safe. It gives police more power to search and seize things that might be used in crimes, like weapons or drugs. It also makes it easier for police to share information with each other and with other agencies, so they can work together better to stop criminals. The law also changes some of the rules for how courts handle criminal cases, to make sure that justice is served fairly and quickly. Overall, the goal of this law is to make it harder for criminals to commit crimes and easier for police to catch them.",

    "summary": "\nThe Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 is a law that helps fight crime and keep communities safe. It does this by giving police more power to stop and search people who might be involved in criminal activity. The law also makes it easier for the police to share information with each other and with other agencies, so they can work together more effectively. Additionally, the law gives the courts more power to deal with criminals and terrorists, and it sets up special units to help investigate and prosecute these types of crimes. Overall, the goal of the law is to make it harder for criminals to commit crimes and to make it easier for the police to catch them when they do."
