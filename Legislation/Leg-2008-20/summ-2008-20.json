    "summary": "The Health and Safety (Offences) Act 2008 changes the punishments for breaking health and safety laws in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Before, some people who broke these laws could get a fine or go to jail. Now, there are new penalties that include more severe fines and even prison time. This law also says how trials will happen and what the most severe punishment will be for each crime. Additionally, the government can change other rules related to health and safety if they need to, as long as Parliament agrees. This law only applies to crimes committed after it became law, so if someone broke the law before then, they won't be affected by this act. In short, this law makes sure that people who break health and safety laws face harsher punishments to keep everyone safe.",
