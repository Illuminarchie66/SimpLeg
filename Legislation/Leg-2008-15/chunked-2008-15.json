taken in relation to a witness incriminal proceedings as the court considers appropriate to ensure that theidentity of the witness is not disclosed in or in connection with theproceedings.\n\t\tThe kinds of measures that may be required to be taken in relation to awitness include measures for securing one or more of the following\u2014\n\t\t\tthat the witness\u2019s name and other identifying details may be\u2014\n\t\t\twithheld; \n\t\t\tremoved from materials disclosed to any party to the proceedings;\n\t\t\tthat the witness may use a pseudonym;\n\t\t\tthat the witness is not asked questions of any specified description thatmight lead to the identification of the witness;\n\t\t\tthat the witness is screened to any specified extent;\n\t\t\tthat the witness\u2019s voice is subjected to modulation to any specifiedextent.\n\t\tSubsection (2) does not affect the generality of subsection (1).\n\t\tNothing in this section authorises the court to require\u2014\n\t\t\tthe witness to be screened to such an extent that the witness cannot beseen by\u2014\n\t\t\tthe judge or other members of the court (if any);\n\t\t\tthe jury (if there is one); or\n\t\t\tany interpreter or other person appointed by the court to assist thewitness;\n\t\t\tthe witness\u2019s voice to be modulated to such an extent that the witness\u2019snatural voice cannot be heard by any persons within paragraph (a)(i) to (iii).\n\t\tIn this section \u201cspecified\u201d means specified in the witness anonymity orderconcerned.\n\tApplications \n\t\tAn application for a witness anonymity order to be made in relation to awitness in criminal proceedings may be made to the court by the prosecutor orthe defendant.\n\t\tWhere an application is made by the prosecutor, the prosecutor\u2014\n\t\t\tmust (unless the court directs otherwise) inform the court of the identityof the witness, but\n\t\t\tis not required to disclose in connection with the application\u2014\n\t\t\tthe identity of the witness, or\n\t\t\tany information that might enable the witness to be identified,\n\t\t\t\tto any other party to the proceedings or his or her legal representatives.\n\t\tWhere an application is made by the defendant, the defendant\u2014\n\t\t\tmust inform the court and the prosecutor of the identity of the witness,but\n\t\t\t(if there is more than one defendant) is not required to disclose inconnection with the application\u2014\n\t\t\tthe identity of the witness, or\n\t\t\tany information that might enable the witness to be identified,\n\t\t\tto any other defendant or his or her legal representatives.\n\t\tAccordingly, where the prosecutor or the defendant proposes to make anapplication under this section in respect of a witness, any relevant materialwhich is disclosed by or on behalf of that party before the determination ofthe application may be disclosed in such a way as to prevent\u2014\n\t\t\tthe identity of the witness, or\n\t\t\tany information that might enable the witness to be identified,\n\t\t\tfrom being disclosed except as required by subsection (2)(a) or (3)(a).\n\t\t\u201cRelevant material\u201d means any document or other material which falls to bedisclosed, or is sought to be relied on, by or on behalf of the partyconcerned in connection with the proceedings or proceedings preliminary tothem.\n\t\tThe court must give every party to the proceedings the opportunity to beheard on an application under this section.\n\t\tBut subsection (6) does not prevent the court from hearing one or moreparties in the absence of a defendant and his or her legal representatives, ifit appears to the court to be appropriate to do so in the circumstances of thecase.\n\t\tNothing in this section is to be taken as restricting any power to makerules of court.\n\tConditions for making order\n\t\tThis section applies where an application is made for a witness anonymityorder to be made in relation to a witness in criminal proceedings.\n\t\tThe court may make such an order only if it is satisfied that Conditions Ato C below are met.\n\t\tCondition A is that the measures to be specified in the order arenecessary\u2014\n\t\t\tin order to protect the safety of the witness or another person or toprevent any serious damage to property, or\n\t\t\tin order to prevent real harm to the public interest (whether affecting thecarrying on of any activities in the public interest or the safety of a personinvolved in carrying on such activities, or otherwise).\n\t\tCondition B is that, having regard to all the circumstances, the taking ofthose measures would be consistent with the defendant receiving a fair trial.\n\t\tCondition C is that it is necessary to make the order in the interests ofjustice by reason of the fact that it appears to the court that\u2014\n\t\t\tit is important that the witness should testify, and\n\t\t\tthe witness would not testify if the order were not made.\n\t\tIn determining whether the measures to be specified in the order arenecessary for the purpose mentioned in subsection (3)(a), the court must haveregard (in particular) to any reasonable fear on the part of the witness\u2014\n\t\t\tthat the witness or another person would suffer death or injury, or\n\t\t\tthat there would be serious damage to property,\n\t\t\t\tif the witness were to be identified.\n\tRelevant considerations\n\t\tWhen deciding whether Conditions A to C in section 4 are met in the case ofan application for a witness anonymity order, the court must have regard to\u2014\n\t\t\tthe considerations mentioned in subsection (2) below, and\n\t\t\tsuch other matters as the court considers relevant.\n\t\tThe considerations are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe general right of a defendant in criminal proceedings to know theidentity of a witness in the proceedings;\n\t\t\tthe extent to which the credibility of the witness concerned would be arelevant factor when the weight of his or her evidence comes to be assessed;\n\t\t\twhether evidence given by the witness might be the sole or decisiveevidence implicating the defendant;\n\t\t\twhether the witness\u2019s evidence could be properly tested (whether on groundsof credibility or otherwise) without his or her identity being disclosed;\n\t\t\twhether there is any reason to believe that the witness\u2014\n\t\t\thas a tendency to be dishonest, or\n\t\t\thas any motive to be dishonest in the circumstances of the case,\n\t\t\t\thaving regard (in particular) to any previous convictions of the witness andto any relationship between the witness and the defendant or any associates ofthe defendant;\n\t\t\twhether it would be reasonably practicable to protect the witness\u2019sidentity by any means other than by making a witness anonymity orderspecifying the measures that are under consideration by the court.\n\tDischarge or variation of order\n\t\tA court that has made a witness anonymity order in relation to any criminalproceedings may subsequently discharge or vary (or further vary) the order ifit appears to the court to be appropriate to do so in view of the provisionsof sections 4 and 5 that applied to the making of the order.\n\t\tThe court may do so\u2014\n\t\t\ton an application made by a party to the proceedings if there has been amaterial change of circumstances since the relevant time, or\n\t\t\ton its own initiative.\n\t\t\u201cThe relevant time\u201d means\u2014\n\t\t\tthe time when the order was made, or\n\t\t\tif a previous application has been made under subsection (2), the time whenthe application (or the last application) was made.\n\tWarning to jury\n\t\tSubsection (2) applies where, on a trial on indictment with a jury, anyevidence has been given by a witness at a time when a witness anonymity orderapplied to the witness.\n\t\tThe judge must give the jury such warning as the judge considersappropriate to ensure that the fact that the order was made in relation to thewitness does not prejudice the defendant.\n\tSpecial provisions for service courts\n\t\tSubsections (2) and (3) apply in relation to criminal proceedings before aservice court consisting of a judge advocate and other members.\n\t\tAny decision falling to be made by the court in such proceedings undersections 2 to 6 is to be made by the judge advocate alone.\n\t\tIf any evidence is given by a witness in such proceedings at a time when awitness anonymity order applies to the witness, the judge advocate must givethe other members such warning as the judge advocate considers appropriate toensure that the fact that the order was made in relation to the witness doesnot prejudice the defendant.\n\t\tEach of the provisions mentioned in subsection (5) has effect with themodification set out in that subsection in a case where\u2014\n\t\t\ta witness anonymity order is made by a service court to which thatprovision applies, and\n\t\t\ta person does anything in relation to the order which would, if the courthad been a court of law having power to commit for contempt, have beencontempt of that court.\n\t\tIn such a case\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 101(1) of the Army Act 1955 (3 & 4 Eliz. 2 c. 18) has effect withthe omission of the words \u201cnot subject to military law\u201d;\n\t\t\tsection 101(1) of the Air Force Act 1955 (3 & 4 Eliz. 2 c. 19) has effectwith the omission of the words \u201cnot subject to air-force law\u201d; and\n\t\t\tsection 65(1) of the Naval Discipline Act [1957 (c.53)](/id/ukpga/1957/53?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\") has effect withthe omission of the words \u201cnot subject to this Act\u201d."
