    "summary": "The Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act of 2008 changed the way witness protection works in criminal cases. Before this law was passed, judges could keep witnesses' names secret from the defense, but now they have to follow specific rules when deciding whether or not to allow witness anonymity. These rules include considering whether keeping the witness's name private would harm the defendant's right to a fair trial. The law applies to all criminal cases starting on or after the day it became law, and some older cases too. It doesn't just cover witnesses who testify in court; it also covers those whose statements are used in investigations."
