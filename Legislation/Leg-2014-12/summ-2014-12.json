    "summary": "The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 gives authorities the power to address problematic behavior in communities through Community Protection Notices (CPNs). These notices can require individuals or organizations to stop specific activities, perform tasks, or take reasonable measures to reduce negative impacts on the community. Appeals to magistrates' courts are available for disputes over CPNs. Failure to comply with CPNs can result in fines, work orders, or even imprisonment. Additionally, the act enables certain individuals or groups to issue notices to those suspected of engaging in anti-social behavior, and designates the College of Policing as the authority responsible for creating rules and guidelines for police forces in England and Wales. The College of Policing can also issue codes of practice and provide services for a fee. Law enforcement agencies can retain fingerprints and DNA profiles of individuals who have been investigated for crimes, even if they were never charged or convicted."
