##### 150Car fuel: calculating the cash equivalent, 
(1)The cash equivalent of the benefit of the fuel is the appropriatepercentage of £14,400., 
(2)The “appropriate percentage” means the appropriate percentage determined inaccordance with sections 133 to 142 for the purpose of calculating the cashequivalent of the benefit of the car for which the fuel is provided., 
(3)But the cash equivalent may be—,

(b)proportionately reduced under section 152;, 
(c)reduced under section 153., 
##### 151Car fuel: nil cash equivalent, 
(1)The cash equivalent of the benefit of the fuel is nil if condition A or Bis met., 
(2)Condition A is met if in the tax year in question—,

(3)The fact that any of the conditions specified in subsection (2) is met forpart of a tax year is to be disregarded if there is a time later in that yearwhen none of those conditions is met., 
(4)Where the cash equivalent is to be proportionately reduced under subsection(1) or (2) (or under both those subsections), the reduced amount is given bythe formula—, 
[![Formula - CE multiplied by \(Y minus D\) divided byY](/ukpga/2003/1/images/ukpga_20030001_en_010)](/ukpga/2003/1/images/ukpga_20030001_en_010?view=plain),

  * D is the total number of days in that year on which either the car is unavailable or one or more of the conditions in subsection (2) is met. , 
##### 153Car fuel: reduction of cash equivalent, 
If a reduction of the cash equivalent of the benefit of the car for which thefuel is provided is made under section 148 (reduction of cash equivalent wherecar is shared), a corresponding reduction is to be made in relation to thecash equivalent of the benefit of the fuel., 
#### Vans: benefit treated as earnings, 
##### 154Benefit of van treated as earnings, 
If this Chapter applies to a van in relation to a particular tax year, thecash equivalent of the benefit of the van is to be treated as earnings fromthe employment for that year., 
##### 155Method of calculating the cash equivalent of the benefit of a van, 
(1)The method of calculation of the cash equivalent of the benefit of a vanfor a tax year depends upon whether the van is a shared van for the whole orany part of that year., 
(2)If the van is not a shared van for the whole or any part of the year, thecash equivalent of the benefit of the van for the year is the value ofexclusive availability calculated in accordance with section 157., 
(3)If the van is a shared van for the whole of the year, the cash equivalentof the benefit of the van for the year is the value of shared availabilitycalculated in accordance with section 160., 
This is subject to subsection (7) where more than one shared van is availableto an employee., 
(4)If the van is a shared van for only part of the year the cash equivalent ofthe benefit of the van for the year is the total of—, 
(a)the value of exclusive availability calculated in accordance with section157 (for the period when it is not a shared van), and, 
(b)the value of shared availability calculated in accordance with section 160(for the period when it is a shared van)., 
This is subject to subsection (7) where more than one shared van is availableto an employee., 
(5)The value of shared availability calculated in accordance with section 160under section 161 (normal calculation) takes account of—, 
(a)the shared van, and, 
(b)where that van is made available by the employer, any other vans madeavailable by the employer (whether or not to the employee or a member of theemployee’s family or household) which are shared vans for the whole or anypart of the tax year in question., 
(6)The value of shared availability calculated in accordance with section 160under section 164 (alternative calculation) takes account of—, 
(a)the shared van, and, 
(b)where that van is made available by the employer, any other vans madeavailable by the employer to the employee or a member of the employee’s familyor household which are shared vans for the whole or any part of the tax yearin question., 
(7)Accordingly, if more than one shared van, which is made available by thesame employer, is available to an employee in a tax year the total of the cashequivalents in respect of those vans is calculated by—, 
(a)taking the value of shared availability calculated once in accordance withsection 160, and, 
(b)if any of those vans is a shared van for only part of the year, adding thevalue of exclusive availability in respect of each of those vans calculated inaccordance with section 157., 
(8)This section is subject to section 166 (limit of cash equivalent)., 
##### 156Meaning of “shared van”, 
(1)For the purposes of sections 155 to 165 a van is a shared van for a periodif condition A or B is met., 
(2)Condition A is met if throughout the period the van is availableconcurrently to more than one employee of the same employer., 
(3)Condition B is met if—, 
(a)the period is one throughout which the van is available to differentemployees of the same employer (a “shared period”), and, 
(b)the circumstances are such that the employee or employees to whom the vanis available at any given time in the period are not necessarily the same asthose to whom it is available at any other given time in the period., 
(4)But if the van is available to only one employee for a period exceeding 30days (an “exclusive period”)—, 
(a)the exclusive period does not count towards any period that would otherwisebe a shared period,, 
(b)the shared period is to be treated as ending when the exclusive periodbegins, and, 
(c)a further shared period may begin after the end of the exclusive period., 
(5)If a van is a shared van for part of a day, it is to be treated for thepurposes of this section as shared throughout that day., 
#### Vans: value of exclusive availability, 
##### 157Value of exclusive availability, 
The value of exclusive availability is calculated as follows—, 
  * _Step 1_, 
Determine the age of the van., 
  * _Step 2_, 
If the age of the van is less than 4 years at the end of the tax year inquestion, the basic value of the van for the year is £500., 
In any other case, the basic value of the van for the year is £350., 
  * _Step 3_, 
Make any deduction from the basic value of the van under section 158 for anyperiods when the van was unavailable or a shared van., 
The resulting amount is the provisional sum., 
  * _Step 4_, 
Make any deduction from the provisional sum under section 159 in respect ofpayments by the employee for the private use of the van., 
The result is the value of exclusive availability., 
##### 158Deduction for periods of unavailability or shared use, 
(1)A deduction is to be made from the basic value of the van calculated understep 2 of section 157 if there are any excluded days during the tax year inquestion., 
(2)In this section an “excluded day” means a day on which—, 
(a)the van is unavailable (see subsection (4)), or, 
(b)the van is a shared van.,

(b)falls after the last day on which the van is available to the employee, or, 
(c)falls within a period of 30 days or more throughout which the van is notavailable to the employee., 
##### 159Deduction for payments for private use, 
(1)A deduction is to be made from the provisional sum calculated under step 3of section 157 if, as a condition of the van being available for theemployee’s private use, the employee—, 
(a)is required in the tax year in question to pay (whether by way of deductionfrom earnings or otherwise) an amount of money for that use, and, 
(b)makes such payment., 
(2)If the amount paid by the employee in respect of that year is equal to orexceeds the provisional sum, the provisional sum is reduced so that the valueof exclusive availability is nil., 
(3)In any other case the amount paid by the employee in respect of the year isdeducted from the provisional sum in order to give the value of exclusiveavailability., 
(4)If the van is a shared van for any part of the tax year in question, thereference in subsection (1) to the employee’s private use in that year is tobe read as a reference to the employee’s private use in that part of the yearwhen the van is not a shared van., 
(5)In this section any reference to the van being available for the employee’sprivate use includes a reference to the van being available for the privateuse of a member of the employee’s family or household.,

  * _Step 2_, 
Determine whether the employee is a participating employee within the meaningof section 162., 
If the employee is not, then the value of shared availability is nil., 
  * _Step 3_, 
Determine the total number of participating employees within the meaning ofsection 162., 
  * _Step 4_, 
Find the basic value of the van for the year under section 163 or, where morethan one van is involved, the basic value of each of those vans for the yearunder that section., 
  * _Step 5_, 
Calculate the reckonable amount which is given by the formula—, 
[![Formula - BV divided byPE](/ukpga/2003/1/images/ukpga_20030001_en_012)](/ukpga/2003/1/images/ukpga_20030001_en_012?view=plain),

In any other case, the provisional sum is the reckonable amount., 
  * _Step 7_, 
Make any deduction from the provisional sum under section 165 in respect ofpayments by the employee for the private use of the van or vans involved., 
The result is the value of shared availability., 
(2)The calculation is made under this section in relation to a participatingemployee regardless of—,

In any other case, the interim value of the van is £350., 
  * _Step 3_, 
Make a deduction from the interim value if there are any excluded days duringthe tax year in question., 
The amount of the deduction is given by the formula—, 
[![Formula - \(E divided by Y\) multiplied byIV](/ukpga/2003/1/images/ukpga_20030001_en_013)](/ukpga/2003/1/images/ukpga_20030001_en_013?view=plain),
