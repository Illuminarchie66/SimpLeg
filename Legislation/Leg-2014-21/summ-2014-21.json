    "general": "The Water Act 2014 is a law that helps keep our water safe and clean. It makes sure that people who use water, like farmers and factories, pay for the water they use. It also helps protect rivers and the sea from pollution. The law says that if someone wants to change how much water they can take from a river, they have to ask permission first. And if they cause any damage, they have to fix it or pay for it. The law also helps people who live near rivers by giving them information about how much water is being used and making sure they are protected from flooding.",
