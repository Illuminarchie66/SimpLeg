    "summary": "The Northern Ireland (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Act 2022 simplifies the way Ministers are appointed and elected in Northern Ireland, making it easier for voters to understand who represents them. It also ensures that Ministers follow strict ethical guidelines to avoid conflicts of interest and maintain high standards of conduct. Additionally, the law allows for petitions of concern to be presented to the Assembly if members are worried about specific issues, giving citizens more power over how their government operates. Finally, the act repeals outdated laws and extends its reach across all of the United Kingdom."
