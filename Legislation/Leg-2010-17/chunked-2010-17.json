(whether or not that person is anassociated person), and\n\t\t\tany opinion of which the court is made aware\u2014\n\t\t\tof the person for whose protection the DVPO would be made, and\n\t\t\tin the

applied for theDVPO.\n\t\tIf the court has reason to suspect that a medical report will be required,the power to remand a person may be exercised for the purpose of enabling amedical examination to take place and a report to be made.\n\t\tIf the person is remanded in custody for that purpose, the adjournment maynot be for more than 3 weeks at a time.\n\t\tIf the person is remanded on bail for that purpose, the adjournment may notbe for more than 4 weeks at a time.\n\t\tIf the court has reason to suspect that the person is suffering from amental disorder within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1983, the courthas the same power to make an order under section 35 of that Act (remand tohospital for medical report) as it has under that section in the case of anaccused person (within the meaning of that section).\n\t\tThe court may, when remanding the person on bail, require the person tocomply, before release on bail or later, with such requirements as appear tothe court to be necessary to secure that the person does not interfere withwitnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice.\n\tGuidance \n\t\tThe Secretary of State may from time to time issue guidance relating to theexercise by a constable of functions under sections 24 to 30.\n\t\tA constable must have regard to any guidance issued under subsection (1)when exercising a function to which the guidance relates.\n\t\tBefore issuing guidance under this section, the Secretary of State mustconsult\u2014\n\t\t\tthe Association of Chief Police Officers,\n\t\t\tthe National Policing Improvement Agency, and\n\t\t\tsuch other persons as the Secretary of State thinks fit.\n\tMinistry of Defence Police\n\t\tA member of the Ministry of Defence Police not below the rank ofsuperintendent may issue a DVPN under section 24 for the protection of anassociated person if either P or the associated person lives in premises whichfall within paragraph (a) of the definition of \u201cservice living accommodation\u201din section 96(1) of the Armed Forces Act 2006.\n\t\tIf a DVPN is issued by a member of the Ministry of Defence Police by virtueof subsection (1), provision may be included in the

instrument providefor any provision of sections 24 to 32 to come into force for a period of timeto be specified in or under the order for the purpose of assessing theeffectiveness of the provision.\n\t\tSuch an order may make different provision for different areas.\n\t\tMore than one order may be made under this section.\n\t\tProvision included in an order under this section does not

or description of persons specified in the order a new numberof days, place, activity, period or description (subject, in the case of anumber of days, to sub-paragraph (2)).\n\tA court may only include an activity requirement in a supervision order orvary such a requirement under sub-paragraph (11) if\u2014\n\t\tit has consulted the youth offending team which is to be, or is, specifiedin the

parental responsibility for a defaulter who is inits care or provided with accommodation by it in the exercise of any socialservices functions, the reference to \u201cguardian\u201d in sub-paragraph (9) is to beread as a reference to that authority.\n\tIn sub-paragraph (14)\u2014\n\t\t\u201cparental responsibility\u201d has the same meaning as it has in the ChildrenAct 1989 by virtue of section 3 of that Act;\n\t\t\u201csocial services functions\u201d has the same meaning as it has in the LocalAuthority Social Services Act 1970 by virtue of section 1A of that Act."
