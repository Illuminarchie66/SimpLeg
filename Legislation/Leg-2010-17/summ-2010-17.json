It also says how the police should handle evidence they find during these searches. The law helps protect people who are victims of domestic violence by giving them more rights. It also gives courts the power to order people not to commit crimes like gang violence or anti-social behavior. The law talks about private security guards and how they can do their jobs. It also deals with things like air guns and how prisoners can use electronic devices. Finally, the law talks about paying money to people who were hurt in terrorist attacks abroad and how alcohol can be sold and supplied.",

Specifically, physical data and DNA profiles collected through surveillance activities must be destroyed within three years of their collection to protect individuals' privacy rights. Additionally, the law allows for the retention of certain materials for up to six years after a person is detained under Schedule 7 or Section 41 of the Crime and Security Act 2010, depending on the age of the individual at the time of their detainment. Furthermore, the legislation sets out rules for how long certain materials can be kept after a person has been arrested but not convicted of any crime.
