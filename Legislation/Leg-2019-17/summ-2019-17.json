    "summary": "\nHello! I'm here to help you understand the Offensive Weapons Act 2019. This act focuses on making it harder for people to get hurt with weapons like knives and corrosive substances. Here's what you need to know:\n\nIf you're under 18, it's illegal to buy or sell certain products that could hurt people. These products include corrosive substances like acid and knives. If you're caught with one of these products, you could face serious consequences, including jail time and fines.\n\nTo protect the public, the government can make special orders called \"knife crime prevention orders.\" These orders can stop people from having certain items that could hurt others. If you're given one of these orders, you might have to give up certain items or follow rules to stay safe.\n\nIf you're found with a weapon that could hurt someone, you could face charges and penalties. But there are some exceptions - for example, if you're using the weapon for a legitimate reason like hunting or self-defense, you might not be charged.\n\nIt's important to remember that these laws apply to everyone, regardless of age or background. So, always be careful when handling weapons and take responsibility for keeping yourself and others safe."
