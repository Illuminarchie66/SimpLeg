It helps keep track of how much each coin should weigh, like making sure a penny really weighs 5 grams instead of 4 or 6 grams. This way, people can trust that their money is worth what it's supposed to be worth!",

This allows for more flexible and precise measurements of gold coins.\n* Simplified point 2: The amendment expands the power of the Secretary of State to regulate coinage by proclamation to include all coins, not just those specified in Schedule 1. This gives the government more flexibility in adjusting the coinage system as needed.\n* Simplified point 3: The Act extends to England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, and comes into force two months after being passed.\n* Simplified point 4: The Act may be cited as the Coinage (Measurement) Act 2011."

    "summary": "The Coinage (Measurement) Act 2011 changes how gold coins are measured to ensure they meet strict standards. Before, the standard was based on a small sample of coins weighed on average. Now, the government can set specific measurements for each gold coin using a more flexible method. This means that gold coins will be even more accurate and reliable. The law applies to all parts of the United Kingdom and came into effect two months after it was passed.  ",
