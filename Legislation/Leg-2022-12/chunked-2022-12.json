(1)\u2014\n\t\t\ta reference to an amount includes any VAT chargeable on that amount;\n\t\t\ta reference to the landlord includes a person acting for the landlord (suchas a managing agent);\n\t\t\t\u201cservice charge\u201d means an amount\u2014\n\t\t\twhich is payable (directly or indirectly) for services, repairs,maintenance, improvements, insurance costs or the landlord\u2019s management costs(including management costs of a superior landlord which the landlord isrequired to pay), and\n\t\t\twhich is a fixed amount or an amount that varies or may vary according tothe

costs in relation to a service charge whether they areincurred, or to be incurred, in the period for which the service charge ispayable or in an earlier or later period.\n\t\tAn amount drawn down by the landlord from a tenancy deposit to meet thewhole or part of a rent debt is to be treated as unpaid rent due from thetenant to the landlord (and such rent is \u201cpaid\u201d where the tenant makes goodany shortfall in the deposit).\n\t\t\u201cBusiness tenancy\u201d means a tenancy to which Part 2 of the Landlord andTenant Act 1954 applies.\n\t\t\u201cEnglish business tenancy\u201d means a

rent debt\u201d is a debt under a business tenancy consisting ofunpaid protected rent.\n\t\tRent due under the tenancy is \u201cprotected rent\u201d if\u2014\n\t\t\tthe tenancy was adversely affected by coronavirus (see section 4), and\n\t\t\tthe rent is attributable to a period of occupation by the tenant for, orfor a period within, the protected period applying to the tenancy (see section5).\n\t\tRent consisting of interest on an unpaid amount within section 2(1)(a) or(b) is to be regarded for the purposes of subsection (2)(b) as attributable tothe same period of occupation by the tenant as that unpaid amount.\n\t\tA period of occupation by the tenant that began, or ended, at a time duringa particular day is to be treated as including the whole of that day.\n\t\tIf any rent due under the tenancy is attributable to a period of occupationby the tenant of which only part is of the description in subsection (2)(b),then so much of the rent as can be reasonably attributed to that part of theperiod is protected rent.\n\t\tAn amount treated by section 2(4) as unpaid rent is to be regarded asunpaid protected rent if the rent debt that was satisfied (in whole or part)by drawing it down from the tenancy deposit would otherwise have been aprotected rent debt.\n\t\u201cAdversely affected by coronavirus\u201d\n\t\tA business tenancy was \u201cadversely affected by

description, or parts of businesses or premises of a specifieddescription, every day at particular times is to be regarded for the purposesof subsection (2)(a) as a closure requirement.\n\t\tIt is immaterial for the purposes of subsection (2)(a) that specificlimited activities were (as an exception) allowed by the regulations to becarried on despite the obligation to close (and accordingly the fact they werepermitted or carried on is to be disregarded in determining whether thetenancy was adversely affected by coronavirus).\n\t\tWhere the premises comprised in the tenancy were occupied by the tenant forthe purposes of a business not carried on solely at or from those premises,the reference in subsection (1)(a) to the business carried on at or from thepremises is to so much of the business as was carried on at or from thepremises.\n\t\tIn this section \u201ccoronavirus regulations\u201d means regulations\u2014\n\t\t\tmade under section 45C of the Public Health (Control of

coronavirus.\n\t\u201cProtected period\u201d\n\t\tThe \u201cprotected period\u201d, in relation to a business tenancy adverselyaffected by coronavirus, is the period beginning with 21 March 2020 and endingwith\u2014\n\t\t\twhere the business tenancy comprises premises in England\u2014\n\t\t\tif subsection (2) identifies a day earlier than 18 July 2021, that day, or\n\t\t\tin any other case, 18

2021.\n\t\tThe relevant day for the purposes of subsection (1)(a)(i) or (b)(i) is thelast day on which (or for part of which)\u2014\n\t\t\tthe whole or part of the business carried on by the tenant at or from thepremises, or\n\t\t\tthe whole or part of those premises,\n\t\t\t\twas of a description subject to either a closure requirement or a specificcoronavirus restriction.\n\t\tIn subsection (2) \u201cspecific coronavirus restriction\u201d means a restriction orrequirement (other than a closure requirement) imposed by coronavirusregulations which regulated any aspect of\u2014\n\t\t\tthe way a business, or a part of a business, of any specified descriptionwas to be carried on, or\n\t\t\tthe way any premises, or any part of premises, of a specified descriptionwere or was to be used.\n\t\tBut

relating to the questions\u2014\n\t\t\twhether there is a protected rent debt of any amount, and\n\t\t\tif so, whether the tenant should be given relief from payment of that debtand, if so, what relief.\n\t\t\u201cRelief from payment\u201d, in relation to a protected rent debt, means any oneor more of the following\u2014\n\t\t\twriting off the whole or any part of the debt;\n\t\t\tgiving time to pay the whole or any part of the debt, including by allowingthe whole or any part of the debt to be paid by instalments;\n\t\t\treducing (including to zero) any interest otherwise payable by the tenantunder the terms of the tenancy in relation to the whole or any part of thedebt."

money, or\n\t\t\trestructuring its business.\n\tTiming of arbitrator\u2019s award\n\t\tSubject to subsection (2), the arbitrator must make an award under section14 as soon as reasonably practicable after\u2014\n\t\t\twhere both parties have put forward a final proposal, the day on which thelatest final proposal is received, or\n\t\t\totherwise, the last day on which a party may put forward a
