It also creates a committee to oversee the process and provides financial incentives for individuals and businesses to reduce waste and recycle more. Additionally, the act allows for the creation of trading schemes to limit emissions and makes changes to the Energy Act of 2004 regarding renewable transport fuels. The main objective of the law is to combat climate change and promote sustainable practices.",

    "summary": "The Climate Change Act of 2008 is a landmark legislation aimed at combating climate change in the United Kingdom. This law sets a legally binding target for the country to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% compared to 1990 levels by the year 2050. To achieve this goal, the government must set carbon budgets every five years and take steps to reduce emissions and increase removals of greenhouse gases. The act also establishes a Committee on Climate Change to advise the government on reducing emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change. Additionally, the act allows the government to create trading schemes to encourage reductions in emissions and provides penalties for non-compliance with the regulations. Overall, this legislation demonstrates the UK's commitment to addressing the urgent issue of climate change and ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come."
