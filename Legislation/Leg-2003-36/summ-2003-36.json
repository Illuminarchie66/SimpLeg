It also allows the government to tell local fire departments what they need to do to keep people safe from fires. This means that the government can make sure that there are enough firefighters on duty at any given time, and that they have the right equipment to put out fires quickly and safely.",

    "summary": "The Fire Services Act 2003 allows the government to set rules about the working conditions of firefighters, such as their pay and benefits. Before making any changes, the government must talk to representatives of fire departments and firefighters to get their opinions. This law also gives the government the power to make changes that apply to the past, and to exempt some people or organizations from following these new rules. However, the government cannot lower the pay or benefits of firefighters retroactively. If there are disagreements about how the June 2003 agreement between fire unions and local governments should be interpreted, these issues can be resolved through mediation, negotiation, or arbitration. In other words, this law helps ensure that firefighters have fair working conditions and that their employers follow the agreed-upon rules.",
