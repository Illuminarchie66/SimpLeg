    "general": "This law helps poorer countries who are struggling with too much debt. It allows them to get rid of some of their debts so they can focus on helping their people and growing their economies. The law makes sure that these countries don't have to pay back all of their debts, which can be a big burden for them. This way, they can use their money for things like building schools, hospitals, and roads instead of just paying off debts.",

    "summary": "The Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act 2010 helps reduce the debt burden of developing countries by limiting the amount that can be recovered from their debts. To qualify for debt relief, a country must meet specific criteria related to its economy and the purpose of the loans. The act applies to judgments and awards related to qualifying debts and provides exemptions for certain developing countries. However, the act has limitations and exceptions, such as not applying to cases before its commencement and allowing for overrides of EU or international obligations."
