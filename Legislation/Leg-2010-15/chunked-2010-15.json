complainant and the respondentin relation to the matters to which the proceedings relate;\n\t\t\torder the respondent to pay compensation to the complainant;\n\t\t\tmake an appropriate recommendation.\n\t\tAn appropriate recommendation is a recommendation that within a specifiedperiod the respondent takes specified steps for the purpose of obviating orreducing the adverse effect of any matter to which the proceedings relate\u2014\n\t\t\ton the complainant;\n\t\t\ton any other person.\n\t\tSubsection (5) applies if the tribunal\u2014\n\t\t\tfinds that a contravention is established by virtue of section 19, but\n\t\t\tis satisfied that the provision, criterion or practice was not applied withthe intention of discriminating against the complainant.\n\t\tIt must not make an order under subsection (2)(b) unless it first considerswhether to act under subsection (2)(a) or (c).\n\t\tThe amount of compensation which may be awarded under subsection (2)(b)corresponds to the amount which could be awarded by a county court or thesheriff under section 119.\n\t\tIf a respondent fails, without reasonable excuse, to comply with anappropriate recommendation in so far as it relates to the complainant, thetribunal may\u2014\n\t\t\tif an order was made under subsection (2)(b), increase the amount ofcompensation to be paid;\n\t\t\tif no such order was made, make
