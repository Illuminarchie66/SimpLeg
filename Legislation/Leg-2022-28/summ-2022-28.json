This is to protect young people from being forced into marriages or partnerships before they are ready, and to ensure that they have the ability to give their full consent to the union. The law also applies to same-sex couples and heterosexual couples equally.",

    "summary": "The Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Act 2022 is a law that raises the minimum age for getting married or entering into a civil partnership from 16 to 18 years old. This means that no one under the age of 18 can get legally married or enter into a civil partnership. The law also makes it illegal for anyone to try to force or trick someone under 18 into getting married or entering into a civil partnership. This new law will help protect young people from being taken advantage of or forced into something they don't want to do before they are ready.",
