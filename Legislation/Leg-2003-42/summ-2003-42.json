    "summary": "The Sexual Offences Act 2003 is a law that aims to prevent sexual offenses and protect victims. It includes provisions for consent, non-consensual sexual activities, and traveling for sexual purposes. The law also covers causing or inciting minors to become prostitutes or participate in pornography, controlling their activities related to prostitution or pornography, and arranging or facilitating their involvement in these activities. Additionally, the law prohibits administering substances to someone without their consent, with the intention of stupefying or overpowering them, so that a sexual activity can be performed on them. It also prohibits committing any offense with the intention of committing a sexual offense, and trespassing on premises with the intention of committing a sexual offense. The law punishes these offenses with imprisonment terms ranging from 6 months to life, depending on the severity of the offense and the method of committing it. Furthermore, the law allows for the making of interim sexual offenses prevention orders (SOPOs) before the final decision on the main application, and it provides for appeals against the making of a SOPO or Interim SOPO. Finally, the law states that breaking any condition of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) or Interim SOPO is a criminal offense, and it allows the police to apply for a legal order preventing known sex offenders from traveling abroad to protect children from potential sexual harm."
