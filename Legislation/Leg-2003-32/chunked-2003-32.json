criminalproceedings,\n\t\t\t\tto any document issued or made by an administrative authority in thatcountry in administrative proceedings,\n\t\t\t\tto any process issued or made for the purposes of any proceedings on anappeal before a court in that country against a decision in administrativeproceedings,\n\t\t\t\tto any document issued or made by an authority in that country for thepurposes of clemency proceedings.\n\t\t\tThe Secretary of State may cause the process or document to be served bypost or, if the request is for personal service, direct the chief officer ofpolice for the area in which that person appears to be to cause it to bepersonally served on him.\n\t\t\tIn relation to any process or document to be served in Scotland, referencesin this section to the Secretary of State are to be read as references to theLord Advocate.\n\t\tService of overseas process: supplementary\n\t\t\tSubsections (2) and (3) apply to any process served in a part of the UnitedKingdom by virtue of section 1 requiring a person to appear as a party orattend as a witness.\n\t\t\tNo obligation under the law of that part to comply with the process isimposed by virtue of its service.\n\t\t\tThe process must be accompanied by a notice\u2014\n\t\t\t\tstating the effect of subsection (2),\n\t\t\t\tindicating that the person on whom it is served may wish to seek advice asto the possible consequences of his failing to comply with the process underthe law of the country where it was issued or made, and\n\t\t\t\tindicating that under that law he may not be accorded the same rights andprivileges as a party or as a witness as would be accorded to him inproceedings in the part of the United Kingdom in which the process is served.\n\t\t\tWhere a chief officer of police causes any process or document to be servedunder section 1, he must at once\u2014\n\t\t\t\ttell the Secretary of State (or, as the case may be, the Lord Advocate)when and how it was served, and\n\t\t\t\t(if possible) provide him with a receipt signed by the person on whom itwas served.\n\t\t\tWhere the chief officer of police is unable to cause any process ordocument to be served as directed, he must at

in spite of the fact that the person onwhom it is to be served is outside the United Kingdom.\n\t\t\tWhere the process is to be served outside the United Kingdom and the personat whose request it is issued or made believes that the person on whom it isto be served does not understand English, he must\u2014\n\t\t\t\tinform the court of that fact, and\n\t\t\t\tprovide the court with a copy of the

witness\u2014\n\t\t\t\tmust not include notice of a penalty,\n\t\t\t\tmust be accompanied by a notice giving any information required to be givenby rules of court.\n\t\t\tIf process requiring a person to appear as a party or attend as a witnessis served outside the United Kingdom, no obligation to comply with the processunder the law of the part of the United Kingdom in which the process is issuedor made is imposed by virtue of the service.\n\t\t\tAccordingly, failure to comply with the process does not constitutecontempt of court and is not a ground for issuing a warrant to secure theattendance of the person in question.\n\t\t\tBut the process may subsequently be served on the person in question in theUnited Kingdom (with the usual consequences for non-compliance).\n\t\tService of process otherwise than by post\n\t\t\tProcess to which section 3 applies may, instead of being served by post, beserved on a person outside the United Kingdom in accordance with arrangementsmade by the Secretary of State.\n\t\t\tBut where the person is in a participating country, the process may beserved in accordance with those arrangements only if one of the followingconditions is met.\n\t\t\tThe conditions are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat the correct address of the person is unknown,\n\t\t\t\tthat it has not been possible to serve the process by post,\n\t\t\t\tthat there are good reasons for thinking that service by post will not beeffective or is inappropriate.\n\t\tGeneral requirements for effecting Scottish citation etc.\n\t\t\tThis section applies to any citation for the purposes of criminalproceedings in Scotland and to any document issued there for such purposes bythe prosecutor or by the court.\n\t\t\tThe citation may proceed or document be issued in spite of the

court.\n\t\t\tIf a citation is effected outside the United Kingdom, no obligation underthe law of Scotland to comply with the citation is imposed by virtue of itsbeing so effected.\n\t\t\tAccordingly, failure to comply with the citation does not constitutecontempt of court and is not a ground for issuing a warrant to secure theattendance of the person in question or for imposing any penalty.\n\t\t\tBut the citation may subsequently be effected against the person inquestion in the United Kingdom (with the usual consequences for non-compliance).\n\t\tEffecting Scottish citation etc. otherwise than by post\n\t\t\tA citation or document to which section 5 applies may, instead of beingeffected or served by post, be effected against or served on a person outsidethe United Kingdom in accordance with arrangements made by the Lord Advocate.\n\t\t\tBut where the person is in a participating country, the citation may beeffected or document served in accordance with those arrangements only if oneof the following conditions is met.\n\t\t\tThe conditions are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthat the correct address of the person is unknown,\n\t\t\t\tthat it has not been possible to effect
