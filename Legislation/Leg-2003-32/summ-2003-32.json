    "general": "This law helps the UK work with other countries to fight crime, especially when it comes to terrorism. It gives the authorities more power to investigate and prosecute crimes that happen outside of the UK, and makes sure that people who commit crimes in one country can be punished in another country if they are a threat to national security. The law also updates an old law from 1981 to make it easier to catch people who make fake documents.",

    "summary": "\nThe Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 helps the UK government work with other countries to fight crime. It lets them serve legal papers on people who live abroad, get evidence from other countries, and transfer prisoners to help with investigations. If someone doesn't follow a legal paper served on them, it might not mean they will face punishment in the UK right away. However, it could lead to more legal actions later on. The UK government can ask for help from other countries to gather evidence for criminal cases and trials. They can do this if there are specific reasons why they think the evidence is important for the investigation. The UK authorities can also work with international joint investigation teams to look into crimes. Banks and other financial institutions have to give the authorities information about customers' accounts and transactions if it's suspected that the customer is involved in severe criminal activity in another country. This law explains different terms used in the act, like \"country,\" \"court,\" and \"criminal proceedings.\" It also says that some countries are considered \"participating countries\" if they are not part of the UK and have been named by the Secretary of State or Scottish Ministers.\nIn addition, the extract focuses on the recognition and enforcement of foreign driving disqualifications in the UK, allowing for appeals against such disqualifications. License holders may be required to present their licenses upon request by the Secretary of State or the Department, depending on the jurisdiction in which they were issued. Furthermore, the UK government can revoke a driver's license if the holder has a disability or prospective disability. Finally, the text discusses modifications to the UK's Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 regarding the exchange of information between nations for criminal investigations and proceedings."
