produced in, or imported into, one part of the United Kingdom(\u201cthe originating part\u201d), and\n\t\t\tcan be sold there without contravening any relevant requirements that wouldapply to their sale,\n\t\t\t\tshould be able to be sold in any other part of the United Kingdom, free fromany relevant requirements that would otherwise apply to the sale.\n\t\tWhere goods are to be sold in a particular way in the other part of theUnited Kingdom, the condition in subsection (1)(b) has effect as if thereference to \u201ctheir sale\u201d were a reference to their sale in that particularway.\n\t\tSo, for example, if goods are to be sold by auction, the condition is met if(and only if) they can be sold by auction in the originating part withoutcontravening any applicable relevant requirements there.\n\t\tWhere the principle applies in relation to a sale of goods in a part of theUnited Kingdom because the conditions in subsection (1)(a) and (b) are met,any relevant requirements there do not apply in relation to the sale.\n\tRelevant requirements for the purposes of section 2\n\t\tThis section defines \u201crelevant requirement\u201d for the purposes of the mutualrecognition principle for goods as it applies in relation to a particular saleof goods in a part of the United Kingdom.\n\t\tA statutory requirement in the part of the United Kingdom concerned which\u2014\n\t\t\tprohibits the sale of the goods or, in the case of an obligation orcondition, results in their sale being prohibited if it is not complied with,and\n\t\t\tis within the scope of the mutual recognition principle,\n\t\t\t\tis a relevant requirement in relation to the sale unless excluded from being arelevant requirement by any provision of this Part.\n\t\tA statutory requirement is within the scope of the mutual recognitionprinciple if it relates to any one or more of the following\u2014\n\t\t\tcharacteristics of the goods themselves (such as their nature, composition,age, quality or performance);\n\t\t\tany matter connected with the presentation of the goods (such as the nameor description applied to them or their packaging, labelling, lot-marking ordate-stamping);\n\t\t\tany matter connected with the production of the goods or anything fromwhich they are made or is involved in their production, including the place atwhich, or the circumstances in which, production or any step in productiontook place;\n\t\t\tany matter relating to the identification or tracing of an animal (such asmarking, tagging or micro-chipping or the keeping of particular records);\n\t\t\tthe inspection, assessment, registration, certification, approval or,authorisation of the goods or any other similar dealing with them;\n\t\t\tdocumentation or information that must be produced or recorded, kept,accompany the goods or be submitted to an authority;\n\t\t\tanything not falling within paragraphs (a) to (f) which must (or must not)be done to, or in relation to, the goods before they are allowed to be sold.\n\t\tA manner of sale requirement is not within the scope of the mutualrecognition principle unless subsection (6) applies.\n\t\tFor this purpose a \u201cmanner of sale requirement\u201d is a statutory requirementthat governs any aspect of the circumstances or manner in which the goods aresold (such as where, when, by whom, to whom, or the price or other terms onwhich they may be sold).\n\t\tA statutory requirement that\u2014\n\t\t\tis worded as a manner of sale requirement, but\n\t\t\tappears to be designed artificially to avoid the operation of the mutualrecognition principle in relation to what would otherwise be a requirementwithin the scope of that principle,\n\t\t\tis to be regarded as a relevant requirement, despite subsection (4).\n\t\t\tThis subsection would apply, for example, where a manner of sale requirementinvolves an unusually restrictive condition such that it would be impossibleto comply with the condition and have a practical chance of selling the goods.\n\t\tA statutory requirement which requires the person selling or acquiring thegoods to keep or submit, after the sale takes place, any documentation orinformation required to be produced or recorded beforehand is to be treated asa relevant requirement relating to the sale.\n\t\tIn this Part \u201cstatutory requirement\u201d means an obligation, a condition or aprohibition (however described) imposed by legislation (including legislationimposing mandatory terms into contracts for the sale of goods).\n\tExclusion of certain requirements existing before commencement\n\t\tA statutory requirement in a part of the United Kingdom (\u201cthe relevantpart\u201d) which\u2014\n\t\t\tapplies in relation to a particular sale of goods in that part of theUnited Kingdom, and\n\t\t\twould otherwise fall within section 3 as a relevant requirement,\n\t\t\t\tis not a relevant requirement (so far as relating to the sale) for thepurposes of the mutual recognition principle where the conditions insubsection (2) are met.\n\t\tThe conditions are that, on the relevant day \u2014\n\t\t\tthe same statutory requirement would have applied in relation to the saleif it had taken place on that day, and\n\t\t\tthere was no corresponding requirement in force in each of the other threeparts of the United Kingdom.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (2) \u201cthe relevant day\u201d is the day before theday on which this section comes into force.\n\t\tThe re-enactment (without substantive change) of a statutory requirementdoes not affect its continuity for the purposes of subsection (2)(a).\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (2)(b) \u201ccorresponding requirement\u201d, inrelation to the statutory requirement in the relevant part of the UnitedKingdom, means a statutory requirement in another part of the United Kingdomthat would have had the same effect in relation to the sale (if it had takenplace there on the relevant day).\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsections (2) and (5) a statutory requirement is tobe regarded as the same as another statutory requirement, or having the sameeffect, if any differences between them are not substantive."

regulator before carrying on a businessof providing particular services.\n\t\tA regulatory requirement is a legislative requirement that would if notsatisfied (whether at a particular point or on a continuing basis) prevent aservice provider from carrying on a business of providing particular services.\n\t\tThe following are neither authorisation requirements nor regulatoryrequirements for the purposes of this Part\u2014\n\t\t\trelevant requirements as defined for the purposes of the mutual recognitionprinciple for goods (see section 3);\n\t\t\tprovision of the sort described in section 24(1) or 28(1) (professionalqualifications and regulation) to the extent it has the effect describedthere;\n\t\t\ta requirement that\u2014\n\t\t\tis in force, or otherwise has effect, on the day before the day on whichthis section comes into force and has not been substantively changed afterthat day, or\n\t\t\tcomes into force, or otherwise takes effect, on or after the day on whichthis section comes into force if it re-enacts or replicates (withoutsubstantive change) a legislative requirement in force or having effectimmediately before that day;\n\t\t\ta requirement that applies to a service provider, but which also applies topersons who do not provide services (for example, a requirement imposingduties on employers);\n\t\t\ta requirement to notify, or register with, a regulator;\n\t\t\ta requirement to provide evidence of being authorised to provide servicesin a part of the United Kingdom other than the part in which the requirementapplies.\n\t\tSubsection (5)(c) does not exclude (and, accordingly, references toauthorisation requirements do include) an authorisation requirement thatapplies in a part of the United Kingdom if, after the relevant day, acorresponding authorisation requirement in another part of the United Kingdomis substantively changed.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (6)\u2014\n\t\t\tan authorisation requirement corresponds to another authorisationrequirement if it relates to the same, or substantially the same, services;\n\t\t\tthe \u201crelevant day\u201d is the day before the day on which this section comesinto force.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section, an authorisation requirement issubstantively changed if a legislative requirement that would, if notsatisfied, prevent a service provider from satisfying the authorisationrequirement is substantively changed.\n\t\tIn this Part\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cservice provider\u201d means a person\u2014 \n\t\t\tthat provides, or intends to provide, services in

specified in the first column of the table in Part 1 ofthat Schedule, to which section 19 (mutual recognition) does not apply;\n\t\t\ta list of services specified in the first column of the table in Part 2 ofthat Schedule, to which sections 20 and 21 (non-discrimination) do not apply;\n\t\t\ta list of authorisation requirements in Part 3 of that Schedule, to whichsection 19 does not apply;\n\t\t\ta list of regulatory requirements in Part 4 of that Schedule, to whichsections 20 and 21 do not apply.\n\t\tThe Secretary of State must keep Schedule 2 under review, and may

agreement, and\n\t\t\tprovides that certain cases, matters, requirements or provision should beexcluded from the application of this Part.\n\t\tA \u201ccommon framework agreement\u201d is a consensus between a Minister of theCrown and one or more devolved administrations as to how devolved ortransferred matters previously governed by EU law are to be regulated after IPcompletion day.\n\t\tReferences in this section to devolved or transferred matters includereference to corresponding matters in England.\n\t\tWhen determining whether a matter is a devolved or transferred matter forthe purposes of this section, the following provisions are to be ignored\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 30A of the Scotland Act 1998;\n\t\t\tsection 109A of the Government of Wales Act 2006;\n\t\t\tsection

department.\n\tServices: mutual recognition of authorisation requirements\n\t\tAn authorisation requirement in relation to the provision of services inone part of the United Kingdom does not apply to a person who is authorised toprovide those services in another part of the United Kingdom.\n\t\tA person is authorised to provide services in a part of the United Kingdomif they have the permission of a regulator that exercises regulatory functionsin relation to the whole of that part to carry on a business of providingthose services in that part.\n\t\tBut, for the purposes of this section, a person is not to be treated asauthorised to provide services in a part of the United Kingdom where thepermission to provide those services only relates to their provision inrelation to particular premises or to a particular place or piece ofinfrastructure.\n\t\tSubsection (1) does not apply to an authorisation requirement to the extentit can reasonably be justified as a response to a public health emergency.\n\tDirect discrimination in the regulation of services\n\t\tA regulatory requirement that directly discriminates against a serviceprovider is of no effect in relation to that service provider.\n\t\tA regulatory requirement directly discriminates against a service providerif\u2014\n\t\t\tit has, or would have, the effect of treating the service provider lessfavourably than other service providers, and\n\t\t\tthe reason for that less favourable treatment is the service provider\u2019srelevant connection, or lack of relevant connection, to a part of the UnitedKingdom.\n\t\tA regulatory requirement is not to be taken to directly discriminateagainst a service provider to the extent the requirement can reasonably bejustified as a response to a public health emergency.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section, a service provider has a relevantconnection to a part of the United Kingdom if the service provider\u2014\n\t\t\thas a registered office, place of business or residence in that part,\n\t\t\tprovides services from that part, or\n\t\t\thas members, partners, officers or staff with a registered office, place ofbusiness, or residence in that part.\n\tIndirect discrimination in the regulation of services\n\t\tA regulatory requirement that indirectly discriminates against an incomingservice provider is of no effect in relation to that incoming serviceprovider.\n\t\tA regulatory requirement indirectly discriminates against an incomingservice provider if\u2014\n\t\t\tit does not directly discriminate against the incoming service provider(within the meaning of section 20),\n\t\t\tit puts the incoming service provider at a relevant disadvantage,\n\t\t\tit has an adverse market effect, and\n\t\t\tit cannot reasonably be considered a necessary means of achieving alegitimate aim.\n\t\tA regulatory requirement puts an incoming service provider at a relevantdisadvantage if\u2014\n\t\t\tit puts the incoming service provider at a disadvantage in relation to theprovision of services in the part of the United Kingdom in which therequirement applies, and\n\t\t\tit does not put, or would not put, each local service provider at thatdisadvantage in relation to the provision of those services in that part (atall or to the same extent).\n\t\tA regulatory requirement puts a service provider at a disadvantage inrelation to the provision of services in a part of the United Kingdom if itmakes it in any way more difficult, or less attractive, for the serviceprovider to provide the services in that part.\n\t\tA regulatory requirement has an adverse market effect if, by putting anincoming service provider (or incoming service providers) at a relevantdisadvantage in relation to the provision of services, it has a significantadverse effect on competition in the market for those services in the UnitedKingdom.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsections (1) to (5)\u2014\n\t\t\tan \u201cincoming service provider\u201d is a service provider that\u2014\n\t\t\tprovides the services in the part of the United Kingdom in which theregulatory requirement applies, but\n\t\t\tdoes not have a relevant connection to that part;\n\t\t\ta \u201clocal service provider\u201d is a service provider that\u2014\n\t\t\tprovides the services in the part of the United Kingdom in which theregulatory requirement applies,\n\t\t\thas a relevant connection to that part, and\n\t\t\tdoes not have a relevant connection to another part of the UnitedKingdom;\n\t\t\ta service provider has a \u201crelevant connection\u201d to a part of the UnitedKingdom if the service provider\u2014\n\t\t\thas a registered office, place of business or residence in that part, or\n\t\t\tprovides the services from that part.\n\t\tIn this section \u201clegitimate aim\u201d means one, or a combination of any, of thefollowing aims\u2014\n\t\t\tthe protection of the life or health of humans, animals or plants;\n\t\t\tthe protection of public safety or security;\n\t\t\tthe efficient administration of justice.\n\t\tThe Secretary of State may by regulations amend subsection (7) so as toadd, vary or remove a legitimate aim.\n\t\tRegulations under subsection (8) are subject to affirmative resolutionprocedure.\n\t\tBefore making regulations under subsection (8), the Secretary of Statemust seek the consent of the Scottish Ministers, the Welsh Ministers and theDepartment for the Economy in Northern Ireland.\n\t\tIf consent to the making of the regulations is not given by any of thoseauthorities within the period of one month beginning with the day on which itis sought from that authority, the Secretary of State may make the regulationswithout that consent.\n\t\tIf regulations are made in reliance on subsection (11), the Secretary ofState must publish a statement explaining why the Secretary of State decidedto make the regulations without the consent of the authority or authoritiesconcerned.\n\t\tThe application of subsection (2)(d) is to be determined with regard, inparticular, to\u2014\n\t\t\tthe effects of the requirement in all the circumstances, and\n\t\t\tthe availability of alternative means of achieving the aim in question.\n\tDuty to review the use of Part 2 amendment powers\n\t\tIn this section \u201cthe Part 2 amendment powers\u201d are the powers conferred bysections 18(2) and 21(8) (powers to amend certain provisions of Part 2).\n\t\tThe Secretary of State must, during the permitted period\u2014\n\t\t\tcarry out a review of any use that has been made of the Part 2 amendmentpowers,\n\t\t\tprepare a report of the review, and\n\t\t\tlay a copy of the report before Parliament.\n\t\tIn carrying out the review the Secretary of State must\u2014\n\t\t\tconsult the Scottish Ministers, the Welsh Ministers and the Department forthe Economy in Northern Ireland,\n\t\t\tconsider any relevant reports made, or advice given, by the Competition andMarkets Authority under Part 4, and\n\t\t\tassess the impact and effectiveness of any changes made under the Part 2amendment powers.\n\t\tThe permitted period is the period beginning with the third anniversary ofthe passing of this Act and ending with the fifth anniversary.\n\t\tIf either of the Part 2 amendment powers has not been used by the time thereview is carried out, this section has effect\u2014\n\t\t\tas if the report required by subsection (2), so far as relating to thatpower, is a report containing\u2014\n\t\t\ta statement to the effect that the power has not been used since it cameinto force, and\n\t\t\tsuch other information relating to that statement as the Secretary ofState considers it appropriate to give, and\n\t\t\tas if the requirements of subsection (3) did not apply in relation to thatpower.\n\tInterpretation of Part 2\n\t\tIn this Part\u2014\n\t\t\t  * \u201cauthorisation requirement\u201d has the meaning given by section 17(3); \n\t\t\t  * \u201clegislative requirement\u201d means a requirement imposed by, or by virtue of, legislation; \n\t\t\t  * \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d means an event or a situation that is reasonably considered to pose an extraordinary threat to human health; \n\t\t\t  * \u201cregulator\u201d means a person exercising regulatory functions, and includes\u2014 \n\t\t\ta Minister of the Crown,\n\t\t\tthe Scottish Ministers,\n\t\t\tthe Welsh Ministers, and\n\t\t\ta Northern Ireland department;\n\t\t\t\t  * \u201cregulatory requirement\u201d has the meaning given by section 17(4). \n\t\tIf a function conferred by legislation may only be exercised in a way thatwould impose a regulatory requirement in respect of which section 20(1) or21(1) applies, the function is to be treated as though it were a regulatoryrequirement for the purposes of those sections (and ignoring section 17(5)).\n\t\tSubsection (2) does not affect the continuation in force or the continuingeffect of a requirement of the sort described in section 17(5)(c) and notpreserved by section 17(6) (existing requirements).\n\t\tAny effect of section 5, 20 or 21 (direct and indirect discrimination forgoods and services) is to be disregarded when considering whether a person isauthorised to provide services in another part of the United Kingdom for thepurposes of section 19 (mutual recognition for services)."
