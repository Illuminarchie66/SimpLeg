[17th December 2020], Be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the adviceand consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this presentParliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—, ## PART 1UK market access: goods, ### Introductory, #### 1Purpose of Part 1, (1)This Part promotes the continued functioning of the internal market forgoods in the United Kingdom by establishing the United Kingdom market accessprinciples., (2)The United Kingdom market access principles are—, (a)the mutual recognition principle for goods (see sections 2 to 4), and, (b)the non-discrimination principle for goods (see sections 5 to 9)., (3)Those principles have no direct legal effect except as provided by thisPart., ### Mutual recognition: goods, #### 2The mutual recognition principle for goods, (1)The mutual recognition principle for goods is the principle that goodswhich—, (a)have been produced in, or imported into, one part of the United Kingdom(“the originating part”), and, (b)can be sold there without contravening any relevant requirements that wouldapply to their sale,, should be able to be sold in any other part of the United Kingdom, free fromany relevant requirements that would otherwise apply to the sale., (2)Where goods are to be sold in a particular way in the other part of theUnited Kingdom, the condition in subsection (1)(b) has effect as if thereference to “their sale” were a reference to their sale in that particularway., So, for example, if goods are to be sold by auction, the condition is met if(and only if) they can be sold by auction in the originating part withoutcontravening any applicable relevant requirements there., (3)Where the principle applies in relation to a sale of goods in a part of theUnited Kingdom because the conditions in subsection (1)(a) and (b) are met,any relevant requirements there do not apply in relation to the sale., #### 3Relevant requirements for the purposes of section 2, (1)This section defines “relevant requirement” for the purposes of the mutualrecognition principle for goods as it applies in relation to a particular saleof goods in a part of the United Kingdom., (2)A statutory requirement in the part of the United Kingdom concerned which—, (a)prohibits the sale of the goods or, in the case of an obligation orcondition, results in their sale being prohibited if it is not complied with,and, (b)is within the scope of the mutual recognition principle,, is a relevant requirement in relation to the sale unless excluded from being arelevant requirement by any provision of this Part., (3)A statutory requirement is within the scope of the mutual recognitionprinciple if it relates to any one or more of the following—, (a)characteristics of the goods themselves (such as their nature, composition,age, quality or performance);, (b)any matter connected with the presentation of the goods (such as the nameor description applied to them or their packaging, labelling, lot-marking ordate-stamping);, (c)any matter connected with the production of the goods or anything fromwhich they are made or is involved in their production, including the place atwhich, or the circumstances in which, production or any step in productiontook place;, (d)any matter relating to the identification or tracing of an animal (such asmarking, tagging or micro-chipping or the keeping of particular records);, (e)the inspection, assessment, registration, certification, approval or,authorisation of the goods or any other similar dealing with them;, (f)documentation or information that must be produced or recorded, kept,accompany the goods or be submitted to an authority;, (g)anything not falling within paragraphs (a) to (f) which must (or must not)be done to, or in relation to, the goods before they are allowed to be sold., (4)A manner of sale requirement is not within the scope of the mutualrecognition principle unless subsection (6) applies., (5)For this purpose a “manner of sale requirement” is a statutory requirementthat governs any aspect of the circumstances or manner in which the goods aresold (such as where, when, by whom, to whom, or the price or other terms onwhich they may be sold)., (6)A statutory requirement that—, (a)is worded as a manner of sale requirement, but, (b)appears to be designed artificially to avoid the operation of the mutualrecognition principle in relation to what would otherwise be a requirementwithin the scope of that principle,, is to be regarded as a relevant requirement, despite subsection (4)., This subsection would apply, for example, where a manner of sale requirementinvolves an unusually restrictive condition such that it would be impossibleto comply with the condition and have a practical chance of selling the goods., (7)A statutory requirement which requires the person selling or acquiring thegoods to keep or submit, after the sale takes place, any documentation orinformation required to be produced or recorded beforehand is to be treated asa relevant requirement relating to the sale., (8)In this Part “statutory requirement” means an obligation, a condition or aprohibition (however described) imposed by legislation (including legislationimposing mandatory terms into contracts for the sale of goods)., #### 4Exclusion of certain requirements existing before commencement, (1)A statutory requirement in a part of the United Kingdom (“the relevantpart”) which—, (a)applies in relation to a particular sale of goods in that part of theUnited Kingdom, and, (b)would otherwise fall within section 3 as a relevant requirement,, is not a relevant requirement (so far as relating to the sale) for thepurposes of the mutual recognition principle where the conditions insubsection (2) are met., (2)The conditions are that, on the relevant day —, (a)the same statutory requirement would have applied in relation to the saleif it had taken place on that day, and, (b)there was no corresponding requirement in force in each of the other threeparts of the United Kingdom., (3)For the purposes of subsection (2) “the relevant day” is the day before theday on which this section comes into force., (4)The re-enactment (without substantive change) of a statutory requirementdoes not affect its continuity for the purposes of subsection (2)(a)., (5)For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) “corresponding requirement”, inrelation to the statutory requirement in the relevant part of the UnitedKingdom, means a statutory requirement in another part of the United Kingdomthat would have had the same effect in relation to the sale (if it had takenplace there on the relevant day)., (6)For the purposes of subsections (2) and (5) a statutory requirement is tobe regarded as the same as another statutory requirement, or having the sameeffect, if any differences between them are not substantive., ### Non-discrimination: goods, #### 5The non-discrimination principle for goods, (1)The non-discrimination principle for goods is the principle that the saleof goods in one part of the United Kingdom should not be affected by relevantrequirements that directly or indirectly discriminate against goods that havea relevant connection with another part of the United Kingdom., (2)For the purposes of the application of that principle in any given case—, (a)the part of the United Kingdom where sale should not be affected isreferred to as the “destination part”;, (b)the goods that have a relevant connection with another part of the UnitedKingdom are referred to as the “incoming goods”;, (c)that other part is referred to as the “originating part”., (3)A relevant requirement (see section 6) is of no effect in the destinationpart if, and to the extent that, it directly or indirectly discriminatesagainst the incoming goods (see sections 7 and 8)., (4)Goods have a relevant connection with a part of the United Kingdom if theyor any of their components—, (a)are produced in that part,, (b)are produced by a business based in that part, or, (c)come from, or pass through, that part before reaching the destination part., (5)For the purposes of this Part—, (a)“components” includes parts, ingredients and constituent materials;, (b)a business is “based”—, (i)where its registered office is,, (ii)if it does not have a registered office, where its head office is, or, (iii)if it has neither a registered office nor a head office, where itsprincipal place of business is., #### 6Relevant requirements for the purposes of the non-discriminationprinciple, (1)This section defines “relevant requirement” for the purposes of the non-discrimination principle for goods., (2)A relevant requirement, for the purposes of the principle as it has effectin relation to a part of the United Kingdom, is a statutory provision that—, (a)applies in that part of the United Kingdom to, or in relation to, goodssold in that part, and, (b)is within the scope of the non-discrimination principle., (3)A statutory provision is within the scope of the non-discriminationprinciple if it relates to any one or more of the following—, (a)the circumstances or manner in

assessment, registration, certification, approval orauthorisation of the goods or any similar dealing with them;, (d)the conduct or regulation of businesses that engage in the sale of certaingoods or types of goods., (4)A statutory provision is not a relevant requirement—, (a)to the extent that it is a relevant requirement for the purposes of themutual recognition principle for goods (see section

attractive, to sell or buy the goods or do anything in connection withtheir sale than if the requirement did not apply., (3)A requirement has an adverse market effect if, because it—, (a)puts at a disadvantage the incoming goods (and any comparable goods thatalso have a relevant connection with the originating part and are also put atthat disadvantage), but, (b)does not put at that disadvantage (at all or to the same extent) some orall comparable goods that have a relevant connection with the destination partand no other part of the United Kingdom,, it causes a significant adverse effect on
