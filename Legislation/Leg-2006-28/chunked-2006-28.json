are smoke-freeonly when open to the public.\n\t\tPremises are smoke-free if they are used as a place of work\u2014\n\t\t\tby more than one person (even if the persons who work there do so atdifferent times, or only intermittently), or\n\t\t\twhere members of the public might attend for the purpose of seeking orreceiving goods or services from the person or persons working there (even ifmembers of the public are not always present).\n\t\t\tThey are smoke-free all the time.\n\t\tIf only part of the premises is open to the public or (as the case may be)used as a place of work mentioned in subsection (2), the premises are smoke-free only to that extent.\n\t\tIn any case, premises are smoke-free only in those areas which are enclosedor substantially enclosed.\n\t\tThe appropriate national authority may specify in regulations what\u201cenclosed\u201d and \u201csubstantially enclosed\u201d mean.\n\t\tSection 3 provides for some premises, or areas of premises, not to besmoke-free despite this section.\n\t\tPremises are \u201copen to the public\u201d if the public or a section of the publichas access to them, whether by invitation or not, and whether on payment ornot.\n\t\t\u201cWork\u201d, in subsection (2), includes voluntary work.\n\tSmoke-free premises: exemptions\n\t\tThe appropriate national authority may make regulations providing forspecified descriptions of premises, or specified areas within specifieddescriptions of premises, not to be smoke-free despite section 2.\n\t\tDescriptions of premises which may be specified under subsection (1)include, in particular, any premises where a person has his home, or is livingwhether permanently or temporarily (including hotels, care homes, and prisonsand other places where a person may be detained).\n\t\tThe power to make regulations under subsection (1) is not exercisable so asto specify any description of\u2014\n\t\t\tpremises in respect of which a premises licence under the Licensing Act[2003 (c. 17)](/id/ukpga/2003/17?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\")authorising the sale by retail of alcohol for consumption on the premises haseffect,\n\t\t\tpremises in respect of which a club premises certificate (within themeaning of section 60 of that Act) has effect.\n\t\tBut subsection (3) does not prevent the exercise of that power so as tospecify any area, within a specified description of premises mentioned insubsection (3), where a person has his home, or is living whether permanentlyor temporarily.\n\t\tFor the purpose of making provision for those participating as performersin a performance, or in a performance of a specified description, not to beprevented from smoking if the artistic integrity of the performance makes itappropriate for them to smoke\u2014\n\t\t\tthe power in subsection (1) also includes power to provide for specifieddescriptions of premises or specified areas within such premises not to besmoke-free in relation only to such performers, and\n\t\t\tsubsection (3) does not prevent the exercise of that power as so extended.\n\t\tThe regulations may provide, in relation to any description of premises orareas of premises

times,\n\t\t\t\tor any combination of those.\n\t\tThe conditions may include conditions requiring the designation inaccordance with the regulations, by the person in charge of the premises, ofany rooms in which smoking is to be permitted.\n\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (5), the references to a performance\u2014\n\t\t\tinclude, for example, the performance of a play, or a performance given inconnection with the making of a film or television programme, and\n\t\t\tif the regulations so provide, include a rehearsal.\n\tAdditional smoke-free places\n\t\tThe appropriate national authority may make regulations designating assmoke-free any place or description of place that is not smoke-free undersection 2.\n\t\tThe place, or places falling within the description, need not be enclosedor substantially enclosed.\n\t\tThe appropriate national authority may designate a place or description ofplace under this section only if in the authority\u2019s opinion there is asignificant risk that, without a designation, persons present there would beexposed to significant quantities of smoke.\n\t\tThe regulations may provide for such places, or places falling within thedescription, to be

descriptions of vehicle which are to be smoke-free,\n\t\t\tfor the circumstances in which they are to be smoke-free,\n\t\t\tfor them to be smoke-free only in specified areas, or except in

be made undersection 85 of the Merchant Shipping Act [1995 (c.21)](/id/ukpga/1995/21?view=plain \"Go to item of legislation\") (safety andhealth on ships), including that section as applied by any

include provision\u2014\n\t\t\tfor the appointment by the Secretary of State of persons to enforce thesmoking provisions (whether in respect of ships generally or for anyparticular case or purpose), and for the removal of any person so appointed,\n\t\t\tfor such persons (if they are not surveyors of ships appointed undersection 256) to have the powers of such surveyors for the purposes of theirenforcement functions,\n\t\t\tfor any such persons to have, for the purposes of their enforcementfunctions, powers corresponding to those which authorised officers have underparagraphs 2(b) to (e), 3 and 4, as read with paragraphs 5 and 9, of Schedule2 to the Health Act 2006 (which confers powers of entry, etc., on authorisedofficers of enforcement authorities in relation to the enforcement of theprovisions of that Act in relation to smoking),\n\t\t\tin relation to an offence of smoking in a place where smoking is prohibitedunder the smoking provisions, for purposes corresponding to those of section 9of and Schedule 1 to the Health Act 2006 (which provide for the giving byauthorised officers of penalty notices in respect of such an offence).\n\t\t\t\tIn this subsection, \u201csmoking\u201d has the same meaning as in Chapter 1 of Part 1of the Health Act 2006.\u201d\n\t\tIn this Chapter, \u201cvehicle\u201d means every type of vehicle, including train,vessel, aircraft
