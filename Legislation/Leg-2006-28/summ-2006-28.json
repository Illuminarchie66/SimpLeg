    "general": "The Health Act 2006 is a law that helps keep people safe from harm caused by smoking, germs, and bad medicine. It makes sure that only adults can buy tobacco and that some places like hospitals and schools are smoke-free. It also helps make sure that doctors and nurses follow good hygiene practices to prevent infections. The law also helps ensure that medicines are safely prescribed and used, and that the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales can recover its costs. Additionally, the law sets up an organization called the Appointments Commission to help appoint people to important positions in the NHS and social care. Overall, the Health Act 2006 is designed to protect public health and safety.",
