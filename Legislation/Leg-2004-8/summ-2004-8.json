Furthermore, the act limited the jurisdiction of visitors of institutions providing higher education and introduced new regulation-making powers to allow for the supply of student support information to specified persons for specific purposes. Lastly, it extended the time for bringing discrimination proceedings related to student complaints and excluded the visitor's jurisdiction in relation to student complaints."
