    "summary": "The Tax Credits Act 2002 simplifies the process of receiving tax credits for low-income families and individuals. It introduces two types of tax credits: Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. To be eligible for these credits, you must meet certain conditions, such as living in the UK and having a certain level of income. The Board of the Inland Revenue is responsible for administering tax credits, and claims must be made jointly or singly. Changes in circumstances must be reported to the Board, and notifications of changes can be given in specified circumstances. The income test applies to determine eligibility for tax credits, and the relevant income is calculated based on the current and previous year's income. The Working Tax Credit entitlement depends on the claimant being engaged in \"qualifying remunerative work.\" The Child Care Element of Working Tax Credit is an element in respect of a portion of childcare expenses, subject to certain limits and requirements related to childcare providers and approvals. The Tax Credits Office (TCO) will decide whether to grant a tax credit and at what rate based on the information provided in the claim. The TCO can request additional information or evidence from the claimant(s) before making their decision, and can also require certain individuals or groups to provide information or evidence of a specific type. The TCO has the power to award a tax credit at a zero rate if they see fit.
