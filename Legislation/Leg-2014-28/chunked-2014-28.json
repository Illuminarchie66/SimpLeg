which theperson has held in respect of the child, and\n\t\t\tsome or all of the amount assessed (\u201cthe relevant debt\u201d) has not been paidto HMRC by the time specified in section 41(5) or 47(4) (as the case may be).\n\t\tHMRC may direct the account provider to pay a specified amount from theaccount to HMRC in order to discharge the whole or part of the relevant debt.\n\t\t\t\u201cSpecified\u201d means specified in the direction.\n\t\tThe account provider must comply with a direction given under this section.\n\t\tSubsections (5) to (8) apply in a case where

(see section 17(3)).\n\t\tWhere the account provider makes a payment to HMRC in accordance with thedirection, the account provider must make a payment from the childcare accountto the account-holder of the appropriate qualifying amount.\n\t\t\u201cThe appropriate qualifying amount\u201d, in relation to a direction under thissection, is the amount which, if paid into a childcare account, would

1(4).\n\t\tWhere the account provider makes a payment to HMRC in accordance with thedirection, the account provider must make a payment from the childcare accountto HMRC of the corresponding top-up

amount\u2014\n\t\t\tany amount payable to HMRC in accordance with the direction made in respectof that other amount is to be set off against the amount payable to theaccount-holder by virtue of subsection (6), and\n\t\t\tany amount payable to HMRC by virtue of subsection (12) is to be set offagainst the amount payable to HMRC in accordance with the direction made inrespect of the amount of recoverable top-up payments.\n\t\tIf the Commissioners provide childcare accounts, a direction under thissection may not be made in respect of any fees charged in connection with achildcare account in accordance with section 15(8).\n\t\tThis section does not affect any other power of HMRC to recover amountsthat are due and payable to HMRC.\n\tSet-off \n\t\tThis section applies where\u2014\n\t\t\tan amount (\u201cthe relevant debt\u201d) is due and payable to HMRC under this Actby a person who holds a childcare account in respect of a child,\n\t\t\tthe childcare account is not active (see section 17(3)), and\n\t\t\tthe relevant debt consists of an amount which the person is liable to payHMRC under any of sections 35 to 39 or section 40(1) (recovery of top-uppayments) as a result of something done, or omitted to be done, in connectionwith that account or any other childcare account which the person has held inrespect of the child.\n\t\tIf the account-holder makes a withdrawal from the childcare account, theamount payable to HMRC under section 22 (the \u201ccorresponding top-up amount\u201d ofthe withdrawal) is to be set off against the relevant debt.\n\t\tIn a case where the whole or part of the corresponding top-up amount of awithdrawal (\u201cthe set-off amount\u201d) is set off against the relevant debt, somuch of the withdrawal as generated the set-off amount is to be ignored forthe purposes of section 19(8).\n\tOrder in which payments are taken to discharge debts\n\t\tThis section applies where an amount (a \u201crelevant debt\u201d) is due and payableto HMRC under this Act by a person.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section\u2014\n\t\t\ta relevant debt is within this paragraph if it consists of a penalty orother amount not falling with paragraph (b) or (c),\n\t\t\ta relevant debt is within this paragraph if it consists of an amount ofrecoverable top-up payments, and\n\t\t\ta relevant debt is within this paragraph if it consists of an amount ofinterest payable under section 51.\n\t\tIn determining whether a relevant debt is an amount of recoverable top-uppayments for the purposes of section 53 or 54, any amount paid to HMRC by theperson in the discharge of a relevant debt is to be taken to have discharged arelevant debt within paragraph (b) of subsection (2) only if any relevant debtwithin paragraph (a) of that subsection has been
