    "general": "This law allows the government to sell (or transfer) the right to receive payments from students who have taken out loans to pay for their education. This means that a new entity, such as a bank or investment company, can take over the responsibility of collecting these payments from the students. The goal of this law is to free up money for the government to use on other things, while still allowing students to continue paying back their loans.",
