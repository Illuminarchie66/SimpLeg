    "general": "This law helps parents who lose their child by giving them time off work and paying them while they grieve. It's like a special kind of sick leave, but instead of being sick, the parent is dealing with the loss of their child. This way, they can take the time they need to say goodbye, sort out funeral arrangements, and deal with their own emotions without having to worry about losing their job or income.",

    "summary": "The Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 helps parents who have lost a child by giving them time off work with pay. This law gives employees the right to take up to two weeks' leave after their child dies, so they can grieve and look after themselves. Employers must give their employees this time off and pay them for it, just like they would for other types of family leave. This law also lets employers choose different dates for different things, like when different parts of the law start working. It's important to remember that this law is here to help parents who have lost a child, and it's meant to be kind and understanding towards them during a difficult time.",
