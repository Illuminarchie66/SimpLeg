missing throughout the period of 90 days ending with the dayon which the application was made,\n\t\t\tin all the circumstances, the appointment of a guardian in respect ofproperty or financial affairs

or\n\t\t\tsuch of those rights and powers as are specified or described in the order,\n\t\t\t\t(but see subsections (5) to (8)).\n\t\tA guardianship order may\u2014\n\t\t\timpose duties on the

apply in relation to a gift made for themaintenance of, or otherwise for the benefit of, a dependant of the missingperson.\n\t\t\u201cDependant\u201d, in relation to a missing person, means an individual who, ifthe missing person were not missing, would reasonably rely on the missingperson to provide for his or her maintenance.\n\tPeriod of guardianship\n\t\tA guardian is appointed for the period specified in the guardianship order.\n\t\tThe period specified in a guardianship order must end before the end of theperiod of 4 years beginning with the day on which the order is made.\n\t\tSubsections (1) and (2) do not prevent the court from making furtherguardianship orders in respect of some or all of the missing person\u2019s propertyand financial affairs, including
