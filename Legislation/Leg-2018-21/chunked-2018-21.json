modify the standard supply licenceconditions so that they include conditions (\u201ctariff cap conditions\u201d) thatimpose a cap on all standard variable and default rates that may be charged bythe holders of supply licences for the supply of gas or electricity underdomestic supply contracts.\n\t\t\tBut this is subject to section 3 (exemptions from the cap).\n\t\tThe Authority\u2014\n\t\t\tmay modify the tariff cap conditions from time to time, but\n\t\t\tmust secure that such conditions continue to be included in the standardsupply licence conditions until they cease to have effect by virtue of section8.\n\t\tThe \u201cstandard supply licence conditions\u201d are the standard conditionsincorporated in supply licences by virtue of section 8 of the Gas Act 1986 orsection 8A of the Electricity Act 1989.\n\t\tIn relation to a domestic supply contract\u2014\n\t\t\t\u201cstandard variable rate\u201d means a rate or amount charged for, or in relationto, the supply of gas or electricity under the contract that is not fixed fora period specified in the contract, and\n\t\t\t\u201cdefault rate\u201d means a rate or amount charged for, or in relation to, thesupply of gas or electricity under the contract that applies if the customerunder the contract fails to choose an alternative rate.\n\t\tModifications made by the Authority under this section may includeconsequential, incidental, supplemental and transitional modifications of thestandard supply licence conditions.\n\t\tThe Authority must exercise its functions under this section with a view toprotecting existing and future domestic customers who pay standard variableand default rates, and in so doing it must have regard to the followingmatters\u2014\n\t\t\tthe need to create incentives for holders of supply licences to improvetheir efficiency;\n\t\t\tthe need to set the cap at a level that enables holders of supply licencesto compete effectively for domestic supply contracts;\n\t\t\tthe need to maintain incentives for domestic customers to switch todifferent domestic supply contracts;\n\t\t\tthe need to ensure that holders of supply licences who operate efficientlyare able to finance activities authorised by the licence.\n\t\tNothing in this section is to be read as requiring the cap imposed on astandard variable or default rate to apply in relation to any charge that\u2014\n\t\t\tforms part of that rate, but\n\t\t\tis not paid on a regular basis by the majority of customers who pay thatrate.\n\tTariff cap conditions\n\t\tTariff cap conditions\u2014\n\t\t\thave effect in relation to supply licences, whenever granted, and domesticsupply contracts, whenever entered into;\n\t\t\tmust set out how the cap is to be calculated, and may make provision aboutassumptions required to be made in making the calculation;\n\t\t\tmay make provision specifying how a standard variable or default rate is tobe identified;\n\t\t\tmay make provision requiring information to be provided by holders ofsupply licences to the Authority for the purposes of exercising functionsrelating to tariff cap conditions;\n\t\t\tmay confer functions on the Authority;\n\t\t\tmay make different provision for different areas or different cases;\n\t\t\tmay do any of the things authorised for supply licences by section7B(5)(a), (6) or (7) of the Gas Act 1986 or section 7(3), (4), (5) or (6A) ofthe Electricity Act 1989.\n\t\tBut tariff cap conditions may not\u2014\n\t\t\texempt holders of supply licences from their application, or\n\t\t\tmake different provision for different holders of supply licences.\n\t\tBefore making the first modifications under section 1 the Authority must,and before making any subsequent modifications under that section theAuthority may, consult such persons as it considers appropriate on themethodology to be used for the purposes of the cap.\n\t\tConsultation undertaken before this Act is passed is as effective for thepurposes of subsection (3) as consultation undertaken after it is passed.\n\tExemptions from the cap\n\t\tTariff cap conditions do not apply in relation to domestic customers who\u2014\n\t\t\tbenefit from the cap on rates or amounts charged for, or in relation to,the supply of gas or electricity provided for by the Energy MarketInvestigation (Prepayment Charge Restriction) Order 2016, made by theCompetition and Markets Authority, or\n\t\t\tbenefit from a cap on such rates or amounts that is a replacement for thecap provided for by that Order.\n\t\tTariff cap conditions may provide for the conditions not to apply inrelation to\u2014\n\t\t\tdomestic customers who benefit from a cap imposed by the Authority on ratesor amounts charged for, or in relation to, the supply of gas or electricity tocustomers who appear to the Authority to be vulnerable by reason of theirfinancial or other circumstances;\n\t\t\tstandard variable rates which apply only if chosen by domestic customersif, or to the extent that, the rates in question appear to the Authority tosupport the production of gas, or the generation of electricity, fromrenewable sources.\n\t\tThe Authority must consult such persons as it considers appropriate aboutwhether and, if so, how to exercise the power conferred by subsection (2)(b).\n\t\tThe Authority may carry out the consultation either before, or in thecourse of, taking the steps described in section 4 in relation to proposedmodifications which consist of or include provision to be made in the exerciseof the power conferred by subsection (2)(b).\n\t\tThe Authority must secure that the consultation is carried out at a timethat will enable it, if it decides to exercise the power conferred bysubsection (2)(b), to do so\u2014\n\t\t\twhen making the first modifications under section 1, or\n\t\t\tif that is not practicable, as soon as practicable after it has made thefirst modifications under that section.\n\t\tConsultation undertaken before this Act is passed is as effective for thepurposes of subsection (3) as consultation undertaken after it is passed."
