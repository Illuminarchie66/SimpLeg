    "summary": "The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act of 2006 focuses on preserving the natural environment and supporting rural areas. It designates Natural England as the body responsible for conserving the natural environment, including promoting nature conservation, managing study facilities, and offering outdoor leisure options. The Commission for Rural Communities speaks up for rural interests, gives advice, investigates, publishes reports, and collects fees for its services. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee advises on nature protection issues, sets industry standards for research and monitoring, and commissions or funds pertinent research initiatives. All public entities in England and Wales must prioritize biodiversity conservation when making decisions and take affordable, practical measures to safeguard and improve protected species and habitats.\nThe Act also forbids damaging or removing the distinctive qualities of places of exceptional scientific interest (SSSIs) without permission, and imposes harsher fines for unauthorized actions within these locations. New rules regulate vehicle access and dedication on public footpaths, allowing restrictions on creating new paths for mechanically driven cars and the ability to eliminate preexisting routes if they weren't included in a final map and statement. Existing unregistered public pathways may be closed if they aren't recorded in a final map and statement. Applications can be submitted to alter the final map and statement to reflect a route as a public right-of-way accessible to all traffic."
