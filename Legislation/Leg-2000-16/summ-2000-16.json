    "summary": "Hello! As a carer for a disabled individual, you might be interested in knowing about the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000. This law ensures that local authorities assess your needs as a carer and provide services to support you in providing care. They may offer direct payments so you can purchase community care services yourself or give you vouchers to use towards respite care. Additionally, the act covers disabled children and allows for direct payments to parents or guardians with parental responsibility for their care. The act will come into effect on a future date determined by the government. Remember, this law applies to England and Wales only, and modifications can be made for the Isle of Scilly through an order by the Secretary of State."
