    "summary": "The National Health Service Reform and Health Care Professionals Act of 2002 created mechanisms for patients to have a voice in the National Health Service (NHS). This includes creating Patients' Forums to represent patient interests and monitor healthcare services. The act also established the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health to advise the government on patient involvement in healthcare decisions. Additionally, the act required Patients' Forums to prepare annual reports and allowed overview and scrutiny committees to review decisions made by the relevant authority. Furthermore, the act transferred functions from Community Health Councils to other bodies and introduced new regulations for healthcare professionals."
