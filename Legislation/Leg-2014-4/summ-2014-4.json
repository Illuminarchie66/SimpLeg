    "summary": "The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act of 2014 regulates lobbying activities in the United Kingdom. It mandates consultant lobbyists to register before engaging in lobbying activities with the government. Failure to comply can result in criminal penalties. Additionally, the law requires recognized third parties to submit weekly reports during a general election period, detailing any substantial donations received. The law also requires trade unions to maintain a register of their members' names and addresses and to appoint an independent person (assurer) to verify the accuracy of the register. The act aims to increase transparency in political financing and lobbying activities."
