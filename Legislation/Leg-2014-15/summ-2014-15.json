    "general": "This law makes rules for companies that want to mine things like metals and minerals from the ocean floor. It helps keep our seas safe and healthy, while also allowing businesses to use the resources they need. The law says that companies must follow strict guidelines to protect the environment and marine life. This means that they can't just dig up whatever they want without thinking about how it might affect other living things or the ocean itself. It also ensures that any profits made from deep sea mining are used to benefit everyone, not just a select few.",
