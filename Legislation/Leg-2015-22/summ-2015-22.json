    "general": "This law helps local governments review their decisions when they say no to events like festivals, concerts, or fairs because of health and safety concerns. It makes sure that the government follows a fair process when making these decisions and that they only say no if there's a real risk to people's health and safety. This law also helps event organizers understand why their event was rejected and gives them a chance to appeal the decision if they think it was unfair.",
