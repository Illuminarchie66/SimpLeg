Failure to comply with these directions without a valid reason can lead to fines.\n* Simplified point 3: The UK government also has the power to issue \"Harbour Closure Orders,\" which can relieve harbor authorities of certain statutory functions or transfer them to another body. These orders can also permit or require the carrying out of works in the harbor and create new interests, rights, or liabilities.\n* Simplified point 4: The process for issuing these closure orders involves publishing guidance, consulting with affected parties, and following a specific procedure outlined in Schedule 3 of the original act. Additionally, the orders can be made only after considering the underlying purpose of permitting or requiring the closure of a harbor.\n* Simplified point 5: The powers granted by these acts apply to both England and Wales, but with some modifications specific to each country. In Wales, the power to make closure orders rests with the Welsh Ministers, while in Scotland, the power resides with the Scottish Ministers."
