is not dual inclusion income, and, 
(b), 
is equal to or exceeds the amount of the DII surplus to which the allocationclaim relates., 
  * _Requirement 4_, 
The allocation claim identifies the amount of matchable income to which theclaim relates., 
  * _Requirement 5_, 
The amount of matchable income to which the claim relates—, 
(a), 
is equal to the amount of the DII surplus to which the claim relates, and, 
(b), 
does not exceed the unused part of the DII shortfall of company B for theshortfall period (see section 259ZMD)., 
(2)If company B makes an allocation claim—, 
(a)the amount of company A’s dual inclusion income for the surplus period isreduced by the amount of matchable income to which the claim relates, and, 
(b)the amount of matchable income to which the claim relates is treated inrelation to company B as if the following assumptions were made., 
(3)The assumptions are that—, 
(a)things done by or to company A in relation to that amount are treated asdone by or to company B, and,

If there is a common period, go to Step 3., 
If there is no common period, there is no previously allocated amount inrelation to the prior allocation claim (and ignore Step 3).,
