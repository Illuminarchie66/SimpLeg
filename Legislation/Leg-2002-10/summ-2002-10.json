It also lets the government use some of the money left over from the previous two years (ending on 31st March 2001 and 2002) to help cover these costs. This helps ensure that the government can keep providing important services like healthcare, education, and defense.",

It doesn't change anything else about how the government works or how much money it can spend overall.",
