    "general": "The Hunting Act of 2004 makes it illegal to hunt wild animals like foxes, deer, or hares using dogs. This means that people can't use dogs to chase and kill these animals for sport. The law also bans an activity called \"hare coursing,\" which is when people let their dogs run after hares in fields. The goal of the law is to protect the welfare of the animals and keep them safe from harm.",

    "summary": "The Hunting Act of 2004 makes it illegal to hunt wild mammals with dogs, unless there's an exemption given by the government. This means that if you use dogs to hunt animals like foxes or deer, you could get fined up to \u00a35,000 and even go to jail! The law also applies to events called hare coursing, where dogs chase after hares. If you take part in these activities or organize them, you could face similar penalties. The government can also confiscate any equipment or animals used in these illegal hunts, and keep them forever. So, it's important to only hunt legally and safely, or else you might end up losing your money and freedom!",
