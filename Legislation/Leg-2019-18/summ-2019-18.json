    "general": "This law changes how people who lack mental capacity can be treated when they need to be kept safe. It makes sure that doctors, social workers, and other caregivers follow certain rules before taking away someone's freedom. These rules are meant to protect vulnerable people from being mistreated or held against their will without proper reason. The goal is to balance safety concerns with respecting individuals' rights as much as possible.",

    "summary": "The Mental Capacity (Amendment) Act 2019 changes the rules around taking away someone's freedom if they lack the mental capacity to give their consent. This only applies in certain situations, like when someone needs medical treatment or vital acts done on their behalf. To do this, a group called a \"responsible body\" must first check if the person can still make some decisions for themselves. If they can't, then the responsible body must decide if taking away their freedom is really needed and if there's no other way to achieve the same goal. The court will also have the power to look into these matters and make decisions about who might owe money for things done under these arrangements. Finally, the government will create a guidebook that explains all of this in more detail.",
    "single": "\n\u2022 The Mental Capacity Act 2005 is amended to allow for deprivation of liberty in specific circumstances.\n\n\u2022 Deprivation of liberty can occur when a person lacks mental capacity to consent to their own care and treatment, and it is deemed necessary for their well-being.\n\n\u2022 Authorization for such deprivation of liberty must be obtained from a court or a designated professional, and there are strict criteria that must be met before it can be carried out.\n\n\u2022 The amendment introduces a new schedule, Schedule AA1, which sets out the requirements for obtaining authorization for deprivation of liberty.\n\n\u2022 The amendment also includes provisions for emergencies, where immediate action is required to protect the individual's well-being.\n\n\u2022 The powers of the court are expanded to determine questions related to the Schedule AA1, including variations or terminations of authorizations.\n\n\u2022 A code of practice must be prepared and reviewed regularly to guide professionals in exercising their functions under the Act."
