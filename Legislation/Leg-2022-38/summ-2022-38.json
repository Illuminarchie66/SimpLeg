    "summary": "The UK government has introduced new legislation to provide financial assistance to individuals who are struggling financially. The Social Security (Additional Payments) Act 2022 offers one-time payments to recipients of certain social security benefits, including universal credit, state pension credit, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, and income support. Additionally, individuals who receive child tax credit or working tax credit may also be eligible for the payment. The purpose of the legislation is to provide a one-time boost to the income of those who need it most. To streamline the process, the administration of additional payments will be treated as if they were a payment or award of a social security benefit. The regulations made under the Act can have effect from the day it comes into force, and the Secretary of State and HMRC must cooperate in exercising their functions in relation to additional payments."
