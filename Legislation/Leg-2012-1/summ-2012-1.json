    "general": "This law allows the government to spend money from the budget for the financial years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, and also allows them to borrow money from the Consolidated Fund to cover these expenses. It's like a permission slip from Parliament for the government to use the country's money and take loans as needed for the next two years. This ensures that the government can continue to function and provide public services without interruption due to lack of funds.",
