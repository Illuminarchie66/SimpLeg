Now, these lists must be updated every year starting on April 1st, instead of just once every five years. This means that the amount of council tax you pay may be reassessed more frequently to better match your property's value. Only billing authorities in England are affected, not those in Wales. The Secretary of State can set specific dates for when new valuation lists must be created.",
