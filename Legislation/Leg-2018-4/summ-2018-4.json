    "summary": "The Supply and Appropriation (Anticipation and Adjustments) Act 2018 gives the UK government permission to spend up to \u00a3273 billion without needing Parliament's approval. This money will be used to pay for things like healthcare, education, and defense over the next few years. Sometimes unexpected costs come up, so this law helps the government make sure it has enough money to keep running smoothly. It also looks after money that was spent last year, just to make sure everything adds up correctly. So, this law helps keep the country running well and makes sure there aren't any big surprises when it comes to spending.",
