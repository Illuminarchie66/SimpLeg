    "summary": "The Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 helps teenagers who were once in foster care transition into independent living. Local authorities must provide advice, assistance, and support to these young adults until they turn 21. They must also appoint a personal advisor for each eligible child and create a \"pathway plan\" to guide their transition. The law requires local authorities to keep in touch with these young people, offer financial support for education and training, and review their pathway plans regularly. Additionally, the law allows for the appointment of personal advisors and the creation of pathway plans for young people aged 16-21 who are not in care but still require support. The government can make regulations regarding pathway plans and their review. The law also provides guidance on supporting care leavers' education and training, and establishes a procedure for considering representations made by children, young people, and advisors about the discharge of local authorities' functions under the act. Finally, the law makes minor changes to existing laws regarding the provision of services for children in need, their families, and others."
