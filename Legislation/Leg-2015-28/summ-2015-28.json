It also helps share information between different healthcare providers so they can give you the best possible care. The law sets rules for how these workers should be trained and checked to make sure they are good at their job. If someone is not good at their job, the law says how they will be dealt with.

    "summary": "The Health and Social Care (Safety and Quality) Act 2015 is a law that aims to improve the quality of health and social care services in England. It sets out rules for service providers to ensure they do not cause avoidable harm to their patients or clients. This means that healthcare workers must follow strict guidelines to provide safe and effective care. Additionally, the law requires service providers to share important information about their patients with other healthcare professionals involved in their care. This helps ensure that everyone involved in a patient's care is on the same page and working together to provide the best possible treatment. The law applies only to England and Wales, but some parts apply to the entire United Kingdom. Finally, the law allows for regulations to be made to implement its provisions, including setting different start dates for different areas or purposes.",
