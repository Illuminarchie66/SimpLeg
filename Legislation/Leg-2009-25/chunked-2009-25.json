character.\n\t\t\tAn image is \u201cpornographic\u201d if it is of such a nature that it mustreasonably be assumed to have been produced solely or principally for thepurpose of sexual arousal.\n\t\t\tWhere (as found in the person\u2019s possession) an image forms part of a seriesof images, the question whether the image is of such a nature as is mentionedin subsection (3) is to be determined by reference to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe image itself, and\n\t\t\t\t(if the series of images is such as to be capable of providing a contextfor the image) the context in which it occurs in the series of images.\n\t\t\tSo, for example, where\u2014\n\t\t\t\tan image forms an integral part of a narrative constituted by a series ofimages, and\n\t\t\t\thaving regard to those images as a whole, they are not of such a naturethat they must reasonably be assumed to have been produced solely orprincipally for the purpose of sexual arousal,\n\t\t\t\t\tthe image may, by virtue of being part of that narrative, be found not to bepornographic, even though it might have been found to be pornographic if takenby itself.\n\t\t\tAn image falls within this subsection if it\u2014\n\t\t\t\tis an image which focuses solely or principally on a child\u2019s genitals oranal region, or\n\t\t\t\tportrays any of the acts mentioned in subsection (7).\n\t\t\tThose acts are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe performance by

must reasonably be assumed to have beenextracted (whether with or without other images) solely or principally for thepurpose of sexual arousal.\n\t\t\tWhere an extracted image is one of a series of images contained in therecording, the question whether the image is of such a nature as is mentionedin subsection (3)(b) is to be determined by reference to\u2014\n\t\t\t\tthe image itself,

connection with determining that question as itapplies in connection with determining whether an image is pornographic.\n\t\t\tIn determining for the purposes of this section whether a recording is

be taken in relation to a witness incriminal proceedings as the court considers appropriate to ensure that theidentity of the witness is not disclosed in or in connection with theproceedings.\n\t\tThe kinds of measures that may be required to be taken in relation to awitness include measures for securing one or more of the following\u2014\n\t\t\tthat the witness\u2019s name and other identifying details may be\u2014\n\t\t\twithheld; \n\t\t\tremoved from materials disclosed to any party to the proceedings;\n\t\t\tthat the witness may use a pseudonym;\n\t\t\tthat the witness is not asked questions of any specified description thatmight lead to the identification of the witness;\n\t\t\tthat the witness is screened to any specified extent;\n\t\t\tthat the witness\u2019s voice is subjected to modulation to any specifiedextent.\n\t\tSubsection (2) does not affect the generality of subsection (1).\n\t\tNothing in this section authorises the court to require\u2014\n\t\t\tthe witness to be screened to such an extent that the witness cannot beseen by\u2014\n\t\t\tthe judge or other members of the court (if any), or\n\t\t\tthe jury (if there is one);\n\t\t\tthe witness\u2019s voice to be modulated to such an extent that the witness\u2019snatural voice cannot be heard by any persons within paragraph (a)(i) or (ii).\n\t\tIn this section \u201cspecified\u201d means specified in the witness anonymity orderconcerned.\n\tApplications \n\t\tAn application for a witness anonymity order to be made in relation to awitness in criminal proceedings may be made to the court by the prosecutor orthe defendant.\n\t\tWhere an application is made by the prosecutor, the prosecutor\u2014\n\t\t\tmust (unless the court directs otherwise) inform the court of the identityof the witness, but\n\t\t\tis not required to disclose in connection with the application\u2014\n\t\t\tthe identity of the witness, or\n\t\t\tany information that might enable the witness to be identified,\n\t\t\t\tto any other party to the proceedings or his or her legal representatives.\n\t\tWhere an application is made by the defendant, the defendant\u2014\n\t\t\tmust inform the court and the prosecutor of the identity of the witness,but\n\t\t\t(if there is more than one defendant) is not required to disclose inconnection with the application\u2014\n\t\t\tthe identity of the witness, or\n\t\t\tany information that might enable the witness to be identified,\n\t\t\tto any other defendant or his or her legal representatives.\n\t\tAccordingly, where the prosecutor or the defendant proposes to make anapplication under this section in respect of a witness, any relevant materialwhich is disclosed by or on behalf of that party before the determination ofthe application may be disclosed in such a way as to prevent\u2014\n\t\t\tthe identity of the witness, or\n\t\t\tany information that might enable the witness to be identified,\n\t\t\tfrom being disclosed except as required by subsection (2)(a) or (3)(a).\n\t\t\u201cRelevant material\u201d means any document or other material which falls to bedisclosed, or is sought to be relied on, by or on behalf of the partyconcerned in connection with the proceedings or proceedings preliminary tothem.\n\t\tThe court must give every party to the proceedings the opportunity to beheard on an application under this section.\n\t\tBut subsection (6) does not prevent the court from hearing one or moreparties in the absence of a defendant and his or her legal representatives, ifit appears to the court to be appropriate to do so in the circumstances of thecase.\n\t\tNothing in this section is to be taken as restricting any power to makerules of court.\n\tConditions for making order\n\t\tThis section applies where an application is made for a witness anonymityorder to be made in relation to a witness in criminal proceedings.\n\t\tThe court may make such an order only if it is satisfied that Conditions Ato C below are met.\n\t\tCondition A is that the proposed order is necessary\u2014\n\t\t\tin order to protect the safety of the witness or another person or toprevent any serious damage to property, or\n\t\t\tin order to prevent real harm to the public interest (whether affecting thecarrying on of any activities in the public interest or the safety of a personinvolved in carrying on such activities, or otherwise).\n\t\tCondition B is that, having regard to all the circumstances, the effect ofthe proposed order would be consistent with the defendant receiving a fairtrial.\n\t\tCondition C is that the importance of the witness\u2019s testimony is such thatin the interests of justice the witness ought to testify and\u2014\n\t\t\tthe witness would not testify if the proposed order were not made, or\n\t\t\tthere would be real harm to the public interest if the witness were totestify without the proposed order being made.\n\t\tIn determining whether the proposed order is necessary for the purposementioned in subsection (3)(a), the court must have regard (in particular) toany reasonable fear on the part of the witness\u2014\n\t\t\tthat the witness or another person would suffer death or injury, or\n\t\t\tthat there would be serious damage to property,\n\t\t\t\tif the witness were to be identified.\n\tRelevant considerations\n\t\tWhen deciding whether Conditions A to C in section 88 are met in the caseof an application for a witness anonymity order, the court must have regardto\u2014\n\t\t\tthe considerations mentioned in subsection (2) below, and\n\t\t\tsuch other matters as the court considers relevant.\n\t\tThe considerations are\u2014\n\t\t\tthe general right of a defendant in criminal proceedings to know theidentity of a witness in the proceedings;\n\t\t\tthe extent to which the credibility of the witness concerned would be arelevant factor when the weight of his or her evidence comes to be assessed;\n\t\t\twhether evidence given by the witness might be the sole or decisiveevidence implicating the defendant;\n\t\t\twhether the witness\u2019s evidence could be properly tested (whether on groundsof credibility or otherwise) without his or her identity being disclosed;\n\t\t\twhether there is any reason to believe that the witness\u2014\n\t\t\thas a tendency to be dishonest, or\n\t\t\thas any motive to be dishonest in the circumstances of the case,\n\t\t\t\thaving regard (in particular) to any previous convictions of the witness andto any relationship between the witness and the defendant or any associates ofthe defendant;\n\t\t\twhether it would be reasonably practicable to protect the witness by anymeans other than by making a witness anonymity order specifying the measuresthat are under consideration by the court.\n\tWarning to jury\n\t\tSubsection (2) applies where, on a trial on indictment with a jury, anyevidence has been given by a witness at a time when a witness anonymity orderapplied to the witness.\n\t\tThe judge must give the jury such warning as the judge considersappropriate to ensure that the fact that the order was made in relation to thewitness does not prejudice the defendant."
