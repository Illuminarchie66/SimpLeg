    "summary": "The Coroners and Justice Act of 2009 sets out rules for investigating suspicious deaths in the United Kingdom. Senior coroners are required to look into any suspicious or unexplained deaths within their area of responsibility. They must investigate if they believe a violent or unnatural death occurred, the cause of death is unknown, or if someone died in custody or state detention. Even if the body is missing or destroyed, the senior coroner can still investigate based on other evidence. Other senior coroners can be asked to help with investigations if needed.\nAn inquest must be held if someone dies in custody or under suspicious circumstances. Juries will be present during inquests if the death was likely caused by a police officer or member of a service police force, or if the death was violent or unnatural. The jury must reach a unanimous decision, but if they don't agree, the jury may still accept the determination or finding if they have deliberated for a reasonable amount of time.\nThe senior coroner or jury will determine the cause and manner of death after hearing evidence at an inquest. These determinations cannot be used to establish criminal or civil liability. Additionally, the act covers the death of military personnel who die while serving abroad, and the Lord Advocate may notify the Chief Coroner to conduct an investigation.\nThe Coroner can ask for a post-mortem examination of the body to figure out how the person died. A suitable practitioner, such as a registered medical practitioner, might carry out the examination. The Coroner can also order the body to be moved to a different location for additional testing.\nFurthermore, the Coroners and Justice Act of 2009 permits the delegation of duties under the Act to others, such as law enforcement organizations. It also contains provisions regarding the sharing of data between law enforcement organizations and the development of guidelines for managing personal data. Finally, the act makes modifications to current laws and regulations to guarantee consistency with the new coroner's law and offers transitional arrangements and saving measures to ensure that prior instances and investigations are unaffected by the revisions."
