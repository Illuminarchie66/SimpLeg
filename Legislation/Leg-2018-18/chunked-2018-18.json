roador other public place in Great Britain,\n\t\t\tthe vehicle is insured at the time of the accident, and\n\t\t\tan insured person or any other person suffers damage as a result of theaccident,\n\t\t\t\tthe insurer is liable for that damage.\n\t\tWhere\u2014 \n\t\t\tan accident is caused by an automated vehicle when driving itself on a roador other public place in Great Britain,\n\t\t\tthe vehicle is not insured at the time of the accident,\n\t\t\tsection 143 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (users of motor vehicles to beinsured or secured against third-party risks) does not apply to the vehicle atthat time\u2014\n\t\t\tbecause of section 144(2) of that Act (exemption for public bodies etc), or\n\t\t\tbecause the vehicle is in the public service of the Crown, and\n\t\t\ta person suffers damage as a result of the accident,\n\t\t\tthe owner of the vehicle is liable for that damage.\n\t\tIn this Part \u201cdamage\u201d means death or personal injury, and any damage toproperty other than\u2014\n\t\t\tthe automated vehicle,\n\t\t\tgoods carried for hire or reward in or on that vehicle or in or on anytrailer (whether or not coupled) drawn by it,

section of the insurer or owner of the vehicle is limited to the amountfor the time being specified in section 145(4)(b) of the Road Traffic Act 1988(limit on compulsory insurance for property damage).\n\t\tThis section has effect subject to section 3.\n\t\tExcept as provided by section 4, liability under this section may not belimited or excluded by a term of an insurance policy or in any other way.\n\t\tThe imposition by this section of liability on the insurer or vehicle ownerdoes not affect any other person\u2019s liability in respect of the accident.\n\tContributory negligence etc\n\t\tWhere\u2014 \n\t\t\tan insurer or vehicle owner is liable under section 2 to a person (\u201ctheinjured party\u201d) in respect of an accident, and\n\t\t\tthe accident, or the damage

apply to a claim in respect ofthe accident brought by the injured party against a person other than theinsurer or vehicle owner.\n\t\tThe insurer or owner of an automated vehicle is not liable under section 2to the person in charge of the vehicle where the accident that it caused waswholly due to the person\u2019s negligence in allowing the vehicle to begin drivingitself when it was not appropriate to do so.\n\tAccident resulting from unauthorised software alterations or failure toupdate software\n\t\tAn insurance policy in respect of an automated vehicle may exclude or limitthe insurer\u2019s liability under section 2(1) for damage suffered by an insuredperson arising from an accident occurring as a direct result of\u2014\n\t\t\tsoftware alterations made by the insured person, or with the insuredperson\u2019s knowledge, that are prohibited under the policy, or\n\t\t\ta failure to install safety-critical software updates that the insuredperson knows, or ought reasonably to know, are safety-critical.\n\t\tBut as regards liability for damage suffered by an insured person who isnot the holder of the policy, subsection (1)(a) applies only in relation tosoftware alterations which, at the time of the accident, the person knows areprohibited under the policy.\n\t\tSubsection (4) applies where an amount is paid by an insurer under section2(1) in

insurer etc to claim against person responsible for accident\n\t\tWhere\u2014 \n\t\t\tsection 2 imposes on an insurer, or the owner of a vehicle, liability to aperson who has suffered damage as a result of an accident (\u201cthe injuredparty\u201d), and\n\t\t\tthe amount of the insurer\u2019s or vehicle owner\u2019s liability to the injuredparty in respect of the accident (including any liability not imposed bysection 2) is settled,\n\t\t\t\tany other person liable to the injured party in respect of the accident isunder the same liability to the insurer or vehicle owner.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section, the amount of the insurer\u2019s or vehicleowner\u2019s liability is settled when it is established\u2014\n\t\t\tby a judgment or decree,\n\t\t\tby an award in arbitral proceedings or by an arbitration, or\n\t\t\tby an enforceable agreement.\n\t\tIf the amount recovered under this section by the insurer or vehicle ownerexceeds the amount which that person has agreed or been ordered to pay to theinjured party (ignoring so much of either amount as represents interest), theinsurer or vehicle owner is liable to the injured party for the difference.\n\t\tNothing in this section allows the insurer or vehicle owner and the injuredparty, between them, to recover from any person more than the amount of thatperson\u2019s liability to the injured party.\n\t\tFor the purposes of\u2014\n\t\t\tsection 10A of the Limitation Act 1980 (special time limit for actions byinsurers etc in respect of automated vehicles), or\n\t\t\tsection 18ZC of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973(actions under this section),\n\t\t\tthe right of action that an insurer or vehicle owner has by virtue of thissection accrues at the time of the settlement referred to

Scotland), by an act or omission givingrise to liability in that person to pay damages.\n\t\tSection 1 of the Congenital Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act 1976 (\u201cthe1976 Act\u201d) has effect for the purposes of section 2 of this Act\u2014\n\t\t\tas if a person were answerable to a child in respect of an accident causedby an automated vehicle when driving itself if the person\u2014\n\t\t\tis or has been liable under section 2 in respect of any effect of theaccident on a parent of the child, or\n\t\t\twould be so liable if the accident caused a parent of the child to sufferdamage;\n\t\t\tas if the provisions of this Part relating to liability under section 2applied in relation to liability by virtue of paragraph (a) above undersection 1 of the 1976 Act;\n\t\t\tas if subsection (6) of section 1 of the 1976 Act (exclusion of liability)were omitted.\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 3(1), the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence)Act 1945 and section 5 of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (contributorynegligence) have effect as if the behaviour of the automated vehicle were thefault of the person made liable for the damage by section 2 of this Act.\n\t\tLiability under section 2 is treated as liability in tort or, in Scotland,delict for the purposes of any enactment conferring jurisdiction on a courtwith respect to any matter.\n\t\tAn insurer or vehicle owner who has a right of action against a person byvirtue of section 5 does not have a right to recover contribution from thatperson under the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 or under section 3
