    "summary": "The UK Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 provides the regulator with the power to intervene in financially struggling NHS Foundation Trusts. The regulator can issue a notice requiring the trust to take specific actions or modify its behavior. If the trust fails to comply with the regulator's notice, the regulator can exercise additional powers such as removing directors or appointing interim directors. The regulator can also require the trust to obtain a moratorium or enter into a voluntary arrangement, and can transfer assets and liabilities to another organization. Additionally, the regulator can enter and inspect the trust's premises and require explanations from prescribed persons regarding documents, records, or items inspected, copied, or provided under Sections 88-90 of the Act. Furthermore, the regulator can investigate complaints about healthcare and social care services in England and make recommendations to the Secretary of State for improving the quality of healthcare and social care services.\nIn addition, the UK government can charge individuals for injuries sustained by them, and can review and appeal certificates issued regarding claims made due to injuries. The government can also collect information regarding injuries sustained by individuals and organizations, and can make payments to hospitals or ambulance trusts when someone receives NHS treatment and is injured while being transported to the hospital."
