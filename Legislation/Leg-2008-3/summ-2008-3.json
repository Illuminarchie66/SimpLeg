    "summary": "The Appropriation Act 2008 gives permission to spend money from the government's budget for the financial year that ended on March 31, 2008. This includes \u00a322 billion for general spending and \u00a315 billion for specific projects and services. The law sets limits on how much can be spent in different areas, like healthcare and education. It also lets the government pay money into the national treasury without having to keep some of the money aside first, as long as certain rules are followed. In other words, this law helps the government manage its finances and make sure there is enough money available for important public services and programs.",
