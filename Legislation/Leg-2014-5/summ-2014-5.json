    "summary": "The Supply and Appropriation (Anticipation and Adjustments) Act 2014 allows the UK government to spend up to \u00a3235 billion for the financial year ending March 31st, 2015. This law also lets the government borrow money from the Consolidated Fund to pay for things like healthcare, education, and defense. The act makes changes to previous laws so that the government can spend more money than it was allowed to spend before. It also ensures that the government has enough money to cover its spending for past years, such as 2011-2012, 2010-2011, 2009-2010, 2008-2009, and 2007-2008. In short, this law helps the UK government manage its finances and make sure it has enough money to fund its activities.",
