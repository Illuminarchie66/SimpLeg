    "summary": "The Health and Social Care Levy Act 2021 introduces a new tax called the \"health and social care levy\" that will help fund health and social care services across the UK. This tax applies to people who have to pay national insurance contributions, like income tax. The tax rate is 1.25% of earnings or profits and starts on April 6, 2023. The money collected from this tax will go towards providing healthcare and social care services in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The tax will be managed by HMRC, and there may be rules in place to reduce the amount you owe or to give you more time to pay. Additionally, there may be some situations where you don't have to pay the levy at all.",
