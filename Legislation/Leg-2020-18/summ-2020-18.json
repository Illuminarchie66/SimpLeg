    "general": "This law allows police officers to arrest someone without a warrant if they are wanted for a serious crime in another country. This means that if someone has committed a crime like murder or terrorism in another country, our police can arrest them here even if they haven't been formally charged yet. The idea is to make it easier to bring criminals to justice by streamlining the process of extraditing them back to their home country.",

    "summary": "The Extradition (Provisional Arrest) Act 2020 is a new law that lets police officers arrest people without a warrant if they are suspected of committing a serious crime in another country. This law applies to all parts of the UK, including British overseas territories like Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. It also means that the government can change when different parts of the law come into effect, and make sure there are no problems with existing laws. This law is important because it helps the UK work with other countries to catch criminals who have committed serious crimes, like murder or terrorism.",
