    "summary": "The Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000 helps people who struggle to heat their homes affordably. It ensures the government creates a plan to reduce fuel poverty, measures its effectiveness, and reports on progress. The act also allows the government to set rules about what's considered affordable heating costs and consults with organizations that represent people in fuel poverty before making changes. Local authorities must work together with the government to help reduce fuel poverty. Additionally, the act covers the costs of implementing these measures and adjusts previous spending to account for the new laws. Overall, the goal of the act is to make sure everyone can keep their homes warm and comfortable without breaking the bank.",
