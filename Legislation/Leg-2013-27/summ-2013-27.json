Finally, it makes changes to Section 33 of the Planning Act 2008 regarding the effect of development consent on other consent regimes.\n* Simplified point 1: The extract removes the requirement for gas transporters to make payments to holders of licenses under Section 7A of the Gas Act 1986.\n* Simplified point 2: This change allows gas transporters to only make payments to holders of licenses under Section 7ZA for gas interconnectors, rather than all license holders under Section 7A.\n* Simplified point 1: The Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 allows for the variation of consents granted under the Electricity Act 1989.\n* Simplified point 2: The variation of these consents can be done through regulations made by the Scottish Ministers or the Secretary of State, depending on the

point 5: The act defines key terms used in the section, including \"the appropriate authority\", \"regulations\", \"Scotland\", \"section 36 consent\", and \"statutory provision\".\n* Simplified point

acquisition of land belonging to a local authority or statutory undertaker, or for compulsory acquisition of rights over land forming part of a common, open space, fuel allotment, or field garden allotment.\n* Simplified point 3: The repeal replaces these provisions with new ones that allow for special parliamentary procedures to be waived if the Secretary of State is satisfied that one of several conditions applies, such as there being no suitable land available for exchange or the acquisition being for a temporary purpose.\n* Simplified point 4: The changes apply to any order granting development consent made after the amendments come into force.\n* Simplified point 1: The text delimited by triple backticks is an extract of clauses from a piece of UK Legislation with the title \"Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013\".\n* Simplified point 2: The extract modifies and explains how certain pieces of legislation can use simplified procedures when passing laws related to compulsory purchases of land. Specifically, it defines \"speical-acquisition provision\" and outlines the process for handling petitions against these orders.

    "summary": "The Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 is a law passed in the United Kingdom that aims to promote economic growth and improve infrastructure development. It contains provisions for compulsory purchases of land and the modification of existing legislation to simplify procedures for these purchases. Some of the key points of the act include allowing developers to submit applications directly to the Secretary of State, removing the power of the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers to intervene in the preparation of local development orders before they are adopted, and modifying the Electricity Act 1989 to simplify procedures for compulsory purchases of land. Additionally, the act provides for the variation of consents granted under the Electricity Act 1989 through regulations made by the Secretary of State or Scottish Ministers, and allows for deemed planning permission for certain types of development, including electricity generation stations and electric lines. Overall, the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 seeks to streamline the process of developing infrastructure projects in the UK."
