This will help stop criminals from hiding their illegal activities by using secret shell companies or hidden bank accounts. The law also gives the government power to look into suspicious wealth and take action if necessary. Finally, the law sets up a list of all foreign entities that own land in the UK and their true owners so we can keep track of who owns what.",
