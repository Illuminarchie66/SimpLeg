    "summary": "The Gender Recognition Act of 2004 enables individuals to legally recognize their gender identity through a straightforward procedure. To apply for a gender recognition certificate, one must have lived in their acquired gender for at least two years and provide evidence of gender dysphoria and medical treatment if necessary. Successful applicants receive a certificate that legally acknowledges their new gender, allowing them to marry, inherit property, and access social security benefits like anyone else. The law ensures that individuals can live their lives freely and authentically, without fear of discrimination or marginalization."
