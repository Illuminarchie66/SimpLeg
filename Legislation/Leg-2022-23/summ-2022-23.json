It also ensures that these subsidies are only given for specific reasons, like helping small farmers or supporting important industries. The goal is to make sure taxpayers' money is being used wisely and not wasted on unnecessary subsidies.",

The act requires public authorities to maintain a database of all subsidies and subsidy schemes they provide, and to ensure that entries in the database are up to date. The act also requires public authorities to obtain a report from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) before giving a subsidy or making a subsidy scheme of particular interest. This helps ensure that subsidies are given in a fair and transparent manner, and that they do not distort competition or harm consumers. Additionally, the act exempts certain subsidies given to respond to national or global economic emergencies, and subsidies given to compensate for natural disasters or other exceptional occurrences."
