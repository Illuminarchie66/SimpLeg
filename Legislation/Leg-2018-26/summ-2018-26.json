    "general": "This law makes sure that buildings used as nursery schools are not charged property taxes, called \"non-domestic rates,\" in England and Wales. This means that these buildings can use their money for things like buying new toys or paying teachers instead of giving it to the government in taxes. The goal is to help these nursery schools provide better care for children.",

    "summary": "The Nursery Grounds Act helps farmers who run childcare businesses on their land by giving them a break on their property taxes. This means they can focus more on taking care of children instead of worrying about paying bills. It also helps keep these important services available in rural areas where there may not be many other job opportunities. This law only applies to England and Wales, and it started helping farmers in 2015/2017. To qualify for the tax break, the buildings must only be used for taking care of plants or animals, and not for other businesses like selling things.",
