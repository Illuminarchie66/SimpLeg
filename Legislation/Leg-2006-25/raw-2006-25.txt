(2)The amount of the ring fence loss in the deemed accounting period isdetermined as follows., 
  * _Step 1_, 
  * Calculate so much of the ring fence loss in the straddling period as, for the purposes of Part 4 of Schedule 19B, is attributable to qualifying E&A allowances for the straddling period.,

  * The amount given by this step is “the amount of the post-1st January 2006 E&A allowances”., 
  * _Step 3_, 
  * Deduct the qualifying Schedule 19B amount and the amount of the post-1st January 2006 E&A allowances from the amount of the ring fence loss in the straddling period., 
  * _Step 4_, 
  * Apportion the remaining amount of that loss (if any) to the deemed accounting period in proportion to the number of days in the deemed accounting period that fall in the straddling period., 
  * The amount given by this step is “the amount of the apportioned loss”., 
  * _Step 5_, 
  * The amount of the ring fence loss in the deemed accounting period is the amount of the apportioned loss plus the amount of the post-1st January 2006 E&A allowances.,
