It also makes sure that students have fair and reasonable payment options when they go to school. This means that schools can offer more resources, like state-of-the-art facilities and top professors, so students can get a great education and prepare for their future careers. Additionally, the law ensures that students are not burdened with too much debt after graduating, which can help them start their lives on a strong financial footing.",

    "summary": "\nThe Higher Education and Research Act of 2017 created the Office for Students (OfS) as a regulatory body for higher education in England, tasking it with promoting quality, choice, and opportunities for students, encouraging competition among providers, using resources efficiently, and promoting equality of opportunity. The OfS has several general duties, including setting out the requirements for universities to register and maintain their registration, ensuring that the ongoing registration conditions of certain providers include a transparency condition, imposing financial penalties on registered higher education providers who breach certain conditions, and refusing to renew an access and participation plan if the provider fails to comply with certain conditions. Additionally, the OfS can impose conditions on universities to grant certain academic titles, such as bachelor's, master's, and doctorates, and honorary degrees, and can assess the quality of higher education provided by institutions that have applied to be registered. Furthermore, the OfS can enter and search premises in England occupied by supported higher education providers or linked institutions if they receive financial support from the OfS, and can request information from unregistered providers. Finally, the OfS can charge institutions fees for registration and other services provided."
