    "summary": "\nThe Ivory Act 2018 is a strict law that regulates the trade in ivory items in the UK. It completely bans the sale, purchase, and ownership of ivory items, with only a few exceptions for rare and valuable items from before 1918. This means that it is now illegal to buy, sell, or own most ivory items, including jewelry, trinkets, and decorative objects. The law also applies to items made of ivory, such as musical instruments or furniture with ivory inlays.\n\nPolice and customs officers have new powers to stop and search people who they think might be breaking the law. If someone is caught with an illegal ivory item, they could face serious penalties, including fines and even prison time.\n\nHowever, there are some exceptions to the rule. For example, if you own a pre-1918 ivory item that is considered to be of outstanding artistic, cultural, or historical value, you may be able to keep it if you follow certain rules and pay a fee. You will need to apply to the government for an exemption certificate, and an expert will need to assess the item to make sure it meets the criteria.\n\nOverall, the Ivory Act 2018 is designed to protect elephants and prevent the illegal ivory trade. It is important to be aware of these new laws and regulations if you own or deal with ivory items."
