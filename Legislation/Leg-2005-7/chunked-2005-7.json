4AShares in research institution spin-out companies\n\t\tIntroduction\n\t\tApplication of this Chapter\n\t\t\tThis Chapter applies where\u2014\n\t\t\t\tan agreement is made for one or more transfers of intellectual property (an\u201cintellectual property agreement\u201d) from one or more research institutions to acompany (a \u201cspin-out company\u201d),\n\t\t\t\ta person acquires shares (or an interest in shares) in the spin-out companybefore the intellectual property agreement is made or within the period of 183days beginning with the date on which it is made,\n\t\t\t\tthe right or opportunity to acquire the shares (or interest in shares) wasavailable by reason of employment by the research institution (or any of them)or by the spin-out company, and\n\t\t\t\tthe person is involved in research in relation to any of the intellectualproperty that is the subject of the intellectual property agreement.\n\t\t\tBut this Chapter does not apply if the avoidance of tax or nationalinsurance is the main purpose (or one of the main purposes) of thearrangements under which the right or opportunity to acquire the shares (orinterest in shares) is made available.\n\t\tTax relief on acquisition\n\t\tMarket value on acquisition\n\t\t\tFor the relevant tax purposes the market value of the shares (or interestin shares) at the time of the acquisition is to be calculated disregarding theeffect on that market value of the intellectual property agreement and anytransfer of intellectual property pursuant to it.\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of subsection (1) \u201cthe relevant tax purposes\u201d are\u2014\n\t\t\t\tdetermining any amount that is to constitute earnings from the employmentunder Chapter 1 of Part 3 (earnings),\n\t\t\t\tdetermining the amount of any gain

acquisition\n\t\tTaxable amount under Chapter 4\n\t\t\tIf the shares are (or interest in shares is) acquired before theintellectual property agreement is made, or before any transfer ofintellectual property pursuant to it, and any benefit deriving from theintellectual property agreement or any such transfer is received by theemployee in connection with the shares (or interest in shares), the taxableamount determined under section 448 (post-acquisition benefits fromsecurities: amount of charge) is to be treated as nil.\n\t\t\tBut this section does not apply if something which affects the shares (orinterest in shares) has been done (at or before the time when the intellectualproperty agreement is made or intellectual property is transferred) as part ofa scheme or arrangement the main purpose (or one of the main purposes) ofwhich is the avoidance of tax or national insurance contributions.\n\t\tDisapplication of Chapters 2 and 3B\n\t\tDeemed election for disapplication of Chapter 2\n\t\t\tIf the shares are restricted securities (or the interest in shares is arestricted interest in securities), the employer and the employee are to betreated as making an election under section 431(1) (election fordisapplication of Chapter 2) in relation to the shares (or interest inshares).\n\t\t\tBut the employer and the employee may agree that subsection (1) is not toapply in relation to

for thepurposes of determining the taxable amount for the purposes of section 426(charge on occurrence of chargeable event) on the occurrence on any chargeableevent in relation to the shares (or interest in shares).\n\t\t\tIn determining under section 428(3) (amount of charge) what would have beenthe market value of the shares (or interest in shares) at the time of theacquisition but for any restrictions (IUMV), that market value is to becalculated disregarding the effect on that market value of the intellectualproperty agreement and any transfer of intellectual property pursuant to it.\n\t\tDisapplication of Chapter 3B\n\t\t\tFor the purposes of Chapter 3B (securities with artificially enhanced marketvalue) neither the intellectual property agreement nor any transfer ofintellectual property pursuant to it are things done otherwise than forgenuine commercial purposes.\n\t\tSupplementary\n\t\tMeaning of \u201cintellectual property\u201d and

treated as arising) to trustees fromproperty held on qualifying trusts for the benefit of a vulnerable person(\u201cqualifying trusts income\u201d), and\n\t\t\ta claim for special tax treatment under this Chapter for the tax year ismade by the trustees.\n\t\tSpecial income tax treatment applies for the tax year in accordance withsections 26 to 29.\n\t\tBut this section does not have effect in relation to the tax year if theproperty from which the qualifying trusts income arises (or is treated asarising) is property in which a person who is a settlor (within the meaninggiven by section 660G(1) and (2) of ICTA) is regarded as having an interestfor the purposes of section 660A of that Act (income arising under settlementwhere settlor retains an interest).\n\tAmount of relief\n\t\tThe trustees' liability to income tax for the tax year is to be reduced by anamount equal to\u2014\n\tTQTI \\- VQTI\n\twhere\u2014\n\t\t  * TQTI is an amount determined in accordance with section 27 (income tax liability of trustees in respect of qualifying trusts income), and \n\t\t  * VQTI is an amount determined in accordance with section 28 (extra tax to which vulnerable person would be liable if qualifying trusts income were income of his). \n\tTrustees' liability: TQTI\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 26, TQTI is the amount of income tax to whichthe trustees would (apart from this Chapter) be liable for the tax year inrespect of the qualifying trusts income arising (or treated as arising) tothem in that year (or to which they would be so liable if their liability werecomputed in accordance with subsection (2) in a case to which that subsectionapplies).\n\t\tIn a case where\u2014\n\t\t\tincome arising (or treated as arising) to the trustees in the tax year(\u201ctotal income\u201d) includes income (\u201cother income\u201d) which is not qualifyingtrusts income, and\n\t\t\tthe trustees have any expenses in the tax year (\u201cthe management expenses\u201d)which are properly chargeable to total income or would be so chargeable butfor any express provisions of the trusts,\n\t\t\t\tthere shall be disregarded, in computing the income tax liability of thetrustees for the tax year in respect of the qualifying trusts income arising(or treated as arising) to them in that year, such part of the managementexpenses as bears the same proportion to all those expenses as other incomebears to total income.\n\t\tThis section is subject to section 29 (vulnerable person election havingeffect for only part of tax year).\n\tVulnerable person\u2019s liability: VQTI\n\t\tFor the purposes of section 26, VQTI is an amount equal to\u2014\n\t\t\tTLV1 \\- TLV2\n\t\twhere\u2014\n\t\t\t  * TLV2 is an amount determined in accordance with subsection (2) (and subsection (4) where it applies) (total tax liability of vulnerable person), and \n\t\t\t  * TLV1 is an amount determined in accordance with subsection (3) (and subsection (4) where it applies) (what total tax liability of vulnerable person would be if his income included qualifying trusts income). \n\t\tTLV2 is the total amount of income tax and capital gains tax to which thevulnerable person would be liable for the tax year if his income tax liabilitywere computed in accordance with subsections (5) and (6).\n\t\tTLV1 is what TLV2 would be if the qualifying trusts income arising (ortreated as arising) to the trustees in the tax year in respect of which thetrustees are liable to income tax were income of the vulnerable person for thetax year.\n\t\tWhere the vulnerable person is non-UK resident during the tax year\u2014\n\t\t\this income tax liability for the purposes of determining TLV1 and TLV2 isto be computed in accordance with the Income Tax Acts on the assumption thathe is resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom throughout the tax year,and\n\t\t\this capital gains tax liability for the purposes of determining TLV1 andTLV2 is to be computed on the assumption that his taxable amount for thepurposes of section 3 of TCGA 1992 is equal to his deemed CGT taxable amount.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section, in a case where income which has arisento the trustees (whenever it arose) is distributed to the vulnerable person inthe tax year, that income is to be disregarded in computing income tax towhich he would be liable for the tax year for the purposes of determining TLV1and TLV2.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section, in computing income tax to which thevulnerable person would be liable for the tax year for the purposes ofdetermining TLV1 and TLV2, there is to be disregarded any relief which isgiven by way of a reduction in the amount of income tax to which thevulnerable person would be liable apart from that relief.\n\t\tFor the purposes of this section\u2014\n\t\t\twhether or not a vulnerable person is non-UK resident is to be determinedin accordance with section 41(2), and\n\t\t\ta non-UK resident vulnerable person\u2019s deemed CGT taxable amount is to bedetermined in accordance with paragraph 3 of Schedule 1.\n\t\tThis section is subject to section 29 (vulnerable person election havingeffect for only part of tax year).\n\tPart years\n\t\tWhere the vulnerable person election has effect for only part of the taxyear (\u201cthe elected part of the tax year\u201d) sections 26, 27 and 28 apply withthe modifications in subsection (2).\n\t\tThose modifications are\u2014\n\t\t\tthat references to the qualifying trusts income arising (or treated asarising) to the trustees in the tax year are to be treated as references tothe qualifying trusts income arising (or treated as arising) to them in theelected part of the tax year, and\n\t\t\tthat the references in section 27(2) to income arising (or treated asarising) to the trustees in the tax year and expenses of the trustees in thetax year are to be treated as (respectively) references to income arising (ortreated as arising) to the trustees in the elected part of the tax year andexpenses of the trustees in that part of the tax year."
