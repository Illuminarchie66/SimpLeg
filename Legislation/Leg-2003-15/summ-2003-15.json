    "general": "This act makes changes to the rules for groups called \"co-operatives\" and \"community benefit societies\" that want to operate like companies but still have a social purpose. It allows these groups to dedicate their assets (like money or property) permanently to helping the community, instead of just making profits for themselves. This way, they can continue to do good things for the community while also following the same rules as companies.",
