    "summary": "The National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 regulates healthcare oversight in Wales. Community Health Councils (CHCs) monitor healthcare quality and report to Regional Health Boards (RHBs). Joint review panels can investigate regional health issues together. Patients can get free help if they complain about healthcare. If hospitals improve, the government might relocate affected residents. Laws, regulations, and guidelines ensure high-quality care across Wales."
