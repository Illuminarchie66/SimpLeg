body, statutory health body, health service provider orNHS contractor (\u201cthe relevant organisation\u201d), and\n\t\t\tthat a person within subsection (3) is accountable for the documents.\n\t\tThe

case of a health service provider or NHS contractor who is anindividual) that individual.\n\t\tA notice under this section must specify or describe the documents to whichit relates.\n\t\tSubject to subsections (6) and (7), the notice may require those documentsto be produced\u2014\n\t\t\tat or by such time as is specified in the notice, or at once, and\n\t\t\tat such place, and in such manner, as is so specified.\n\t\tWhen specifying a time at or by which the documents must be produced, thenotice must not require them to be produced otherwise than at a reasonablehour.\n\t\tIf the notice requires documents to be produced at once, it may only beserved at a reasonable hour.\n\t\tAn authorised officer may, by agreement with the person served with anotice within subsection (6) or (7), vary the notice so as to extend the timefor compliance with it.\n\t\tAny notice under this section, and any variation of such a notice undersubsection (8), must be in writing.\n\t\tAn individual is \u201caccountable\u201d for any documents if he has either day-to-day, or an overall, responsibility for the custody or control of thedocuments.\n\tProduction of documents\n\t\tThis section applies

documents so produced,\n\t\t\trequire the person producing any such documents to provide an explanationof any of them.\n\t\tIf\u2014 \n\t\t\tthe officer takes away any such document, and\n\t\t\tthe person producing it requests the officer to provide him with a copy ofit, and\n\t\t\tthe request appears to the officer to be reasonable in the circumstances,\n\t\t\t\tthe officer must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, provide that personwith a copy of the document (in such form as the officer considersappropriate).\n\t\tDocuments produced in compliance with a notice under section 145 may beretained for so long as the Welsh Ministers consider that it is necessary toretain them (rather than copies of them) in connection with the exercise ofany of their functions to which this Part applies.\n\t\tIf the Welsh Ministers have reasonable grounds for believing\u2014\n\t\t\tthat any such documents may have to be produced for the purposes of anylegal proceedings, and\n\t\t\tthat they might otherwise be unavailable for those purposes,\n\t\t\tthey may be retained until the proceedings are concluded.\n\t\tIf a person who is required by a notice under section 145 to produce anydocuments does not produce the documents in compliance with the notice, anauthorised officer may require that person to state, to the best of hisknowledge and belief, where they are.\n\t\tA person is not bound to comply with any requirement imposed by a noticeunder section 145 or any requirement under subsection (6) unless evidence ofauthority is given\u2014\n\t\t\tat the time when the notice is served, or\n\t\t\tat the time when the requirement is imposed under subsection (6).\n\t\tIn addition, a person may not be required under section 145 or subsection(6) to produce any document or

section applies if the Welsh Ministers give a direction under section24 directing a Special Health Authority to exercise so much of their functionsunder sections 145 and 146 as is specified in the directions (\u201cthe delegatedfunctions\u201d).\n\t\tThe Welsh Ministers may give directions providing for senior officers ofthe Special Health Authority to exercise the delegated functions on behalf ofthe Special Health Authority.\n\t\t\u201cSenior officer\u201d means an officer of or above a level specified in thedirections.\n\t\tThe Welsh Ministers may by regulations make such provision as they considerappropriate in connection with the exercise of the delegated functions.\n\t\tThe regulations may, in particular, make provision\u2014\n\t\t\tspecifying conditions as to training that must be satisfied in relation toofficers of the Special Health Authority involved in the exercise of thedelegated functions,\n\t\t\tfor requiring officers to obtain specific authorisation before thedelegated functions are exercised in relation to personal records,\n\t\t\tproviding for the designation of officers for the purpose of giving suchauthorisations,\n\t\t\totherwise prescribing the manner in which the delegated functions may beexercised.\n\tCode of practice relating to delegated functions\n\t\tThe Welsh Ministers may issue a code of practice relating to\u2014\n\t\t\tthe exercise of functions

by or on behalf of a SpecialHealth Authority in the exercise of such functions.\n\t\tThe Welsh Ministers must keep the code under review and may from time totime\u2014\n\t\t\trevise the whole or any part of the code, and\n\t\t\tissue a revised code.\n\t\tWhere the Welsh Ministers propose to issue a code of practice under thissection they must\u2014\n\t\t\tprepare a draft of the code, and\n\t\t\tconsult such persons as they consider appropriate about the draft.\n\t\tWhere the Welsh Ministers propose to issue a revised code under thissection which in their opinion would result in a substantial change in thecode, they must\u2014\n\t\t\tprepare a draft of the revised code, and\n\t\t\tconsult such persons as they consider appropriate about the change.\n\t\tWhere, following consultation under subsection (3) or (4), the WelshMinisters issue the code or revised code (whether in the form of the draft orwith such modifications as they consider appropriate), it comes into force atthe time when it is issued by the Welsh Ministers.\n\t\tA failure to observe any provision of a code or revised code issued underthis section does not of itself make a person liable to any criminal or civilproceedings.\n\t\tA code or revised code issued under this section is admissible in evidencein any criminal or civil proceedings.\n\t\tConsultation undertaken by the Welsh Ministers before the commencement ofthis section is as effective for the purposes of this section as consultationundertaken after that time.\n\tDisclosure of information\n\t\tThis section applies to information

possible fora person who obtains the information as a direct or indirect consequence ofthe disclosure to ascertain the individual\u2019s identity from that informationtaken with other information obtained by virtue of section 145 or 146 anddisclosed by or on behalf of the Welsh Ministers.\n\t\tThe discloser must take all reasonable steps to ensure that, once disclosedby him in accordance with section 149(3), the protected information is notfurther disclosed to any person who is not someone to whom it is necessary todisclose the information for any purpose connected with the
