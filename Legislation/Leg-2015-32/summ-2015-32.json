    "summary": "The European Union (Finance) Act 2015 allows the UK government to contribute financially to the European Union. This law changes how the EU gets its money by agreeing on a new way of raising funds called \"own resources\". This means that instead of each country paying a set amount, they will now pay based on their ability to do so. This change will help the EU raise more money and make it easier for countries to contribute. The law also updates the definition of \"the Treaties\" and \"the EU Treaties\" to include the new system of own resources. This law applies to the entire UK and came into effect two months after it was passed.",
