It expands the definition of \"threatened with homelessness\" to include those who have received a valid eviction notice and have limited time left in their current home. Local authorities must provide personalized plans to eligible applicants and take reasonable steps to help them secure suitable accommodation. The act also introduces new duties for local authorities to assist homeless individuals and families, and provides for reviews of the authority's decisions and notices to the applicant. Additionally, it ensures that care leavers have a local connection to their district, allowing them access to housing support services. Public authorities in England must refer cases of potential homelessness to local housing authorities, and the government can create guidelines called \"codes of practice\" to help local housing authorities better understand their responsibilities regarding homelessness."
