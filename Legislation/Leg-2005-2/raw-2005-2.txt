(2)Where the Secretary of State makes an application for permission to make anon-derogating control order against an individual, the application must setout the order for which he seeks permission and—, 
(a)the function of the court is to consider whether the Secretary of State’sdecision that there are grounds to make that order is obviously flawed;, 
(b)the court may give that permission unless it determines that the decisionis obviously flawed; and, 
(c)if it gives permission, the court must give directions for a hearing inrelation to the order as soon as reasonably practicable after it is made., 
(3)Where the Secretary of State makes a non-derogating control order againstan individual without the permission of the court—,

(10)The power of the court to renew a derogating control order is exercisableon as many occasions as the court thinks fit; but, on each occasion, it isexercisable only if—,
