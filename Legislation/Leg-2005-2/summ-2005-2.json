    "general": "This law allows the government to order people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities to do certain things, like report regularly to the police or stay away from certain places. It also gives courts the power to review these orders if someone thinks they are unfair or wrong. The goal of the law is to help stop future acts of terrorism by keeping an eye on people who might be planning something bad.",

Derogating obligations are those that are incompatible with the individual's right to liberty under Article 5 of the Human Rights Convention.\n* Simplified point 3: The power to make control orders is exercisable by the Secretary of State, except in cases where the obligations being imposed are incompatible with the individual's right to liberty under Article 5 of the Human Rights Convention, in which case the court must make the order upon application by the Secretary of State.\n* Simplified point 4: The obligations that may be imposed by a control order include restrictions on possession or use of certain items or substances, restrictions on use of services or facilities, restrictions on work or other occupations, restrictions on association or communication with specified persons, and requirements to report to authorities or submit to electronic monitoring.\n* Simplified point 5: The legislation defines \"involvement in terrorism-related activity\" as including the commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of terrorism, as well as conduct that facilitates or supports such acts.

    "summary": "The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 gives the British government the power to make control orders against individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. These orders can require the individual to report regularly to the authorities, stay away from specific areas or people, and follow other rules designed to protect the public from a risk of terrorism. The government can issue these orders without needing to go to court, but the court can review and quash the orders if they are deemed flawed. The law also allows for the detention of individuals suspected of terrorism-related activities before a formal charge is made, and empowers authorities to hold suspects for up to 48 hours without charge. The Act sets out penalties for those found guilty of violating certain requirements set forth by a control order, and allows for the appeal of certain decisions made by the Home Secretary regarding non-derogating control orders. The Act limits its duration to 12 months, subject to possible extensions by order made by the Secretary of State, and allows for the reporting and review of its operation."
