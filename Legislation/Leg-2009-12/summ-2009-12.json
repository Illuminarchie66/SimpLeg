    "summary": "The Political Parties and Elections Act of 2009 improves transparency and accountability in political financing by requiring political parties to disclose donations and loans. This law also established the Electoral Commission's functions, including investigative powers and civil sanctions for violations. The law mandates political parties to obtain written declarations from donors before accepting large donations, with penalties for making false declarations. Furthermore, the law introduces new requirements for verifying the residency status of donors and modifies existing schedules to the 2000 Act to correspond with the changes made. The primary goal of these modifications is to enhance transparency and accountability in political financing by ensuring that only eligible donors can contribute to political parties."
