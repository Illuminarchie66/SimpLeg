It also creates an office to check if the government's finances are correct and publishes reports on how much money the government has and how it is being spent. This helps ensure that the government is using taxpayers' money wisely and making good financial decisions.",

    "summary": "\nThe Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act of 2011 is a law that helps the Treasury make sure it's managing the country's money well. It does this by making the Treasury create a document called a \"charter\" that explains what it wants to do and how it plans to do it. This charter includes things like the Treasury's goals and how it plans to reach them.\nThe law also creates a group called the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which checks to see if the Treasury's plans are good for the country's finances. The OBR looks at things like how much money the government has, how much it spends, and whether it's likely to have enough money in the future.\nThe OBR also has to follow certain rules, like being objective and transparent, and taking into account any important government policies. The OBR then sends its findings to the Treasury and Parliament so everyone can see what it found.\nAdditionally, the law sets up the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG), who oversees public spending in the UK. They make sure that government departments are spending their money wisely and accurately report on the public finances.\nFinally, the law allows the Treasury to make changes to existing laws through orders called \"statutory instruments\" if necessary to implement the act's provisions. This ensures a smooth transition to the new budget responsibility and audit requirements."
