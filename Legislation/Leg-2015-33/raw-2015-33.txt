(2)The deposit-taker must comply with sub-paragraph (1) as soon as isreasonably practicable and, in any event, within the period of 5 working daysbeginning with the day on which the hold notice is

anything, or permitanything to be done, that would reduce the amount standing to the credit ofthat account below the held amount in relation to that account;, (b)the second type of action is to—, (i)transfer an amount equal to the held amount from the affected account intoan account created by the deposit-taker for the sole purpose of containingthat transferred amount (a “suspense account”), and, (ii)put in place such arrangements as are necessary to ensure that thedeposit-taker does not do anything, or permit anything to be done, that wouldreduce the amount standing to the credit of that

the excess as doesnot exceed the specified amount, and, (b)if the available amount does not exceed the safeguarded amount, nil., For the meaning of “the safeguarded amount” and “the specified amount” seeparagraph 23(1)., (2)If there is more than one relevant account in existence at the time thedeposit-taker complies with paragraph 6(1), “the held amount” in relation toeach relevant account is determined as follows—,   * _Step 1_, Determine the available amount in respect of each relevant account.,   * _Step 2_, Determine the total of the available amounts in respect of all of the relevantaccounts., If that total does not exceed the safeguarded amount, the held amount inrelation to each relevant account is nil (and no further steps are to betaken)., In any other case, go to Step 3.,   * _Step 3_, Match the safeguarded amount against the available amounts in respect of therelevant accounts, taking those accounts in reverse priority order (see sub-paragraph (6)).,   * _Step 4_, Match the specified amount against what remains of the available amounts inrespect of the relevant accounts by taking each relevant account in priorityorder (see sub-paragraph (5)) and matching the specified amount (or, as thecase may be, what remains of the specified amount) against the availableamount for each account until either—, (a), the specified amount has been fully

the credit of the account as is matchedagainst the specified amount under Step 4, and, (ii), accordingly, is nil if no amount standing to the credit of the account is somatched against the specified amount., (3)In this paragraph “the available amount” means—, (a)in the case of an account other than a joint account, the amount standingto the credit of that account at the time the deposit-taker complies withparagraph 6(1), or, (b)in the case of a joint account, the appropriate fraction of the amountstanding to the credit of that account at that time;, so, if no amount stands to the credit of an account at that time, “theavailable amount” is nil., (4)In this paragraph “the appropriate fraction”, in relation to a jointaccount, means—, [![](/ukpga/2015/33/images/ukpga_20150033_en_023)](/ukpga/2015/33/images/ukpga_20150033_en_023?view=plain), where N is the number of persons who together hold the joint account., (5)In this paragraph
