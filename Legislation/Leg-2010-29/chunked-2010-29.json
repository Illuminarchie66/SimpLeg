does not matter for the purpose of subsection (1) whether a flood iscaused by\u2014\n\t\t\theavy rainfall,\n\t\t\ta river overflowing or its banks being breached,\n\t\t\ta dam overflowing or being

case the potential harmful consequences to be considered inassessing risk include, in particular, consequences for\u2014\n\t\t\thuman health,\n\t\t\tthe social and economic welfare of individuals and

a risk, or\n\t\t\totherwise taking action in respect of a risk or a factor relevant to theassessment of a risk (including action for the purpose of flood defence).\n\t\tIn particular, risk management includes things done\u2014\n\t\t\tthat increase the probability of an event but reduce or alter its potentialconsequences, or\n\t\t\tthat increase the probability of an event occurring at one time or in oneplace but reduce the probability of it occurring at another time or in anotherplace.\n\t\tThe following are examples of things that might be done in the course offlood or coastal erosion risk management\u2014\n\t\t\tplanning, erecting, maintaining, altering or removing buildings or otherstructures (including structures built or used for flood defence purposes),\n\t\t\tmaintaining or restoring natural processes,\n\t\t\treducing or increasing the level of water in a place (whether or not itresults in a change to the water level in another place),\n\t\t\tcarrying out work in respect of a river or other watercourse (such astaking things out of it or supporting or diverting the banks),\n\t\t\tmoving things onto, off or around a beach, or carrying out other works inrespect of the shoreline,\n\t\t\tusing statutory or other powers to permit, require, restrict or preventactivities,\n\t\t\tmaking arrangements for financial or other support for action taken bypersons in respect of a risk of, or in preparing to manage the consequencesof, flooding or coastal erosion,\n\t\t\tmaking arrangements for forecasting and warning,\n\t\t\tpreparing, gathering and disseminating maps, plans,
