    "summary": "The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 is a law passed in England and Wales to help manage flood and water risks. It covers many topics, including rules for building structures that can withstand flooding, requirements for developers to agree with sewage undertakers before constructing new drainage systems, and the ability of water undertakers to offer discounted rates for community groups for surface water drainage. The law also allows for the creation of strategies for managing flood and coastal erosion risks in Wales, and gives local authorities the power to perform activities that might result in flooding or coastal erosion if they believe it will benefit nature preservation, cultural heritage, or people's appreciation of the environment or cultural heritage. Additionally, the law requires water companies to temporarily ban certain water uses during times of drought or water scarcity, and allows the government to regulate the provision of infrastructure for water and sewage systems."
