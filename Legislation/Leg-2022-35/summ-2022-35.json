    "general": "This law changes how court cases are handled. It makes sure that when a judge reviews a decision, they can only look at specific parts of the decision and not the whole thing. This will help speed up the process of reviewing decisions and make it easier for judges to decide which parts of a decision should be changed or kept the same. The law also says that some decisions made by a higher court called the Upper Tribunal cannot be challenged in court. Additionally, the law allows for more paperless and digital hearings in courts and tribunals to make the process more efficient and environmentally friendly.",

Specifically, the Lord Chancellor must obtain the concurrence of the Lord Chief Justice for regulations related to civil and family proceedings, and the concurrence of the Senior President of Tribunals for regulations related to proceedings in various tribunals. Additionally, the Lord Chief Justice may delegate their concurrence function to a judicial office holder.\n\nIn simpler terms, this means that the Lord Chancellor must get approval from senior judges before making rules about legal proceedings in England and Wales. This is to ensure that the rules are fair and just, and that they do not interfere with the independence of the judiciary."
