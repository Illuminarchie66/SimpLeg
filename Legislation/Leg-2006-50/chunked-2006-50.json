collection in a public place, a local authority must determinethe application within the prescribed period by either\u2014\n\t\t\tissuing a permit in respect of the collection, or\n\t\t\trefusing the application on the ground specified in section 60(1).\n\t\tWhere a local authority issue such a permit, it shall (subject to section61) have effect in respect of the date or dates specified in the applicationin accordance with section 58(3)(a).\n\t\tAt the time of issuing a permit under this section, a local authority mayattach to it such conditions within paragraphs (a) to (d) below as they thinkfit, having regard to the local circumstances of the collection\u2014\n\t\t\tconditions specifying the day of the week, date, time or frequency of thecollection;\n\t\t\tconditions specifying the locality or localities within their area in whichthe collection may be conducted;\n\t\t\tconditions regulating the manner in which the collection is to beconducted;\n\t\t\tsuch other conditions as may

regulationsunder section 63 (whether or not prescribing conditions for the purposes ofthat subsection).\n\t\tWhere a local authority\u2014\n\t\t\trefuse to issue a permit, or\n\t\t\tattach any condition to it,\n\t\t\t\tthey must serve on the applicant written notice of their decision and thereasons for their decision.\n\t\tThat notice must also state the right of appeal conferred by section 62(2)and the time within which such an appeal must be brought.\n\tRefusal of permits\n\t\tThe only ground on which a local authority may refuse an application for apermit to conduct a collection in a public place is that it appears to themthat the collection would cause undue inconvenience to members of the publicby reason of\u2014\n\t\t\tthe day or the week or date on or in which,\n\t\t\tthe time at which,\n\t\t\tthe frequency with which, or\n\t\t\tthe locality or localities in which,\n\t\t\t\tit is proposed to be conducted.\n\t\tIn making a decision under subsection (1), a local authority may haveregard to the fact (where it is the case) that the collection is proposed tobe conducted\u2014\n\t\t\twholly or partly in a locality in which another collection in a publicplace is already authorised to be conducted under this Chapter, and\n\t\t\ton a day on which that other collection is already so authorised, or on theday falling immediately before, or immediately after, any such day.\n\t\tA local authority must not, however, have regard to the matters mentionedin subsection (2) if it appears to them\u2014\n\t\t\tthat the proposed collection would be conducted only in one location, whichis on land to which members of the public would have access only\u2014\n\t\t\tby virtue of the express or implied permission of the occupier of the land,or\n\t\t\tby virtue of any enactment, and\n\t\t\tthat the occupier of the land consents to that collection being conductedthere;\n\t\t\tand for this purpose \u201cthe occupier\u201d, in relation to unoccupied land, means theperson entitled to occupy it.\n\t\tIn this section a reference to a collection in a public place authorisedunder this Chapter is a reference to a collection in a public place that\u2014\n\t\t\tis conducted in accordance with section 48, or\n\t\t\tis an exempt collection by virtue of section 50.\n\tWithdrawal or variation etc. of permits\n\t\tWhere subsection (2), (3) or (4) applies, a local authority who have issueda permit under section 59 may\u2014\n\t\t\twithdraw the permit,\n\t\t\tattach any condition (or further condition) to the permit, or\n\t\t\tvary any existing condition of the permit.\n\t\tThis subsection applies where the local authority\u2014\n\t\t\thave reason to believe that there has been a change in the circumstanceswhich prevailed at the time when they issued the permit, and\n\t\t\tare of the opinion that, if the application for the permit had been made inthe new circumstances, they would not have issued the permit or would haveissued it subject to different or additional conditions.\n\t\tThis subsection applies where the local authority have reason to believethat any information provided to them by the holder of a permit (or, wherethere is more than one holder, by any of them) for the purposes of theapplication for the permit was false or misleading in a material particular.\n\t\tThis subsection applies where the local authority have reason to

authority under subsection (1)(whether by attaching a new condition to the permit or by varying an existingcondition) must be one that it would be appropriate for the authority toattach to the permit under section 59(3) if the holder was applying for it inthe circumstances prevailing at that time.\n\t\tThe exercise by a local authority of the power conferred by paragraph (b)or (c) of subsection (1) on one occasion does not prevent them from exercisingany of the powers conferred by that subsection on a subsequent occasion; andon any subsequent occasion the reference in subsection (2)(a) to the time whenthe local authority issued the permit is a reference to the time when theylast exercised any of those powers.\n\t\tWhere under this section a local authority\u2014\n\t\t\twithdraw a

this section, they mustsend a copy of their decision and the reasons for it to the Commission.\n\t\tWhere a local authority under this section withdraw a permit, attach anycondition to a permit, or vary an existing condition of a permit, the permitshall continue to have effect as if it had not been withdrawn or (as the casemay be) as if the condition had not been attached or
