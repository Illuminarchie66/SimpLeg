    "summary": "The Stamp Duty Land Tax (Temporary Relief) Act 2020 is a law that helps people buying homes by reducing the amount of tax they have to pay on their purchase. This reduction only lasts for a certain period of time, from July 8th 2020 to March 31st 2021. The amount of tax you pay will depend on how much your home costs, with higher prices leading to higher taxes. There's also a special table that shows how much tax you'll pay based on the price of your home. If you enter into a contract to buy a home during the temporary relief period, even if the conveyance is done after the period ends, you can still benefit from the reduced tax rates. So, if you're looking to buy a home, this law might help you save some money!",
